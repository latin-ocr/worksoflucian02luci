The master told it me ; he seemed a good sort of a man, and very civil :
after setting sail, he said, with a pretty fair wind, on the seventh day they
came in sight of “)(· Acamas, from whence, by a contrary wind, they wcrc
driven back to Phoenicia ; and on the tenth, a great storm coming on, they
were blown to the Chelidonian issand, where they were very near being all
drowned. I have sailed that way myself, and remember that there used to
be a prodigious surge there, especially when the wind blew south-west,
when it generally happens that the Lycian sea is divided from the Pamphy·
lian, 'and the waves break in such a manner upon the sharp rocks, with a
most dreadful noise, and rise to such a height that they seem as large as the
rocks themselves, and upon a level with them; hither, he told me, they
were driven in the midst of a night totally dark; when, by the mercy of
the gods, compaffionating their unhappy condition, a fite appeared from
Lycia, which shewed them where they were, and at the same time a bright-
star, ψ Castor or Pollux, {hone at the top of the main-mast, and dirceted
them to put off to sea, as they were on the point osdashing against the rock.
From thence getting out of their right way, they croffed the AEgean, seventy
days after leaving Egypt, the north-east blowing full against them; they ar-
rived yesterday at the Piraeus, instead of leaving Crete on their right and
paffing Malea, which, before this time, would have brought them into

Italy. LYCINUS.
