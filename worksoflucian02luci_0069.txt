To

DR· SAMUEL JOHNSON,

THE DEMoNAx‘oF THE PRESENT AGE;

THIS PlECE IS INSCRIBED‚ BY

A SINCERE ADMIRER OF HIS TRULY RESPECTABLE CHARACTER,

THE TR·'ANSLATOR.

DEMONAX.

LucmN has here rescuedfrom Oblivion a Charaffler well worthy of being tranfinitted
to Posterity 3 it is, indeed, fhmething extraordinary, especially as Demonax lived
to see so great an Age, that no other Writer should have mentioned a Person of such

singular Accomplishments. Our Author has jhelon, in this little Trafl, that he
could excel as much in Panegyric asin Satire3 the Whole being a strious well-
written Encomium, on a Man whom he was intimately acquaintea' with, and who
fiems to have been not only a good Philofhpher and ¹, virtuous Citizen, bttt a Man of
Wit and Genius alst). The Colleflion os Bons—.Mots which LuchN has attribut-
ed to his Friend is carious} and gives us an imperfecfl Idea of that kind ofsticial Plea-
Jantty, and Repartee, which was fashionable in those Times. Some of them are
very arch and severe, others laughable, anda few, to say the truth, rather dull
and unintelligible.

HE age we live in cannot be reproached as entirely destitute of men
worthy to be recorded, either for extraordinary strength of body, ox·
for the more noble accomplishments of the mind. As instances of both, I
shall mention ἃ· *Sostratus of Boeotia, whom the Greeks called Hercules, for
as such they esteemed him, and Demonax, the philosopher3 these l have seen

ἱ· Sostratus] The same man, it is supposed, as is mentioned by Philostratus, who tell us he
was eight feet high, διε. Lucian had, it seems, written along history of him, which, how-
ever, is not come down to us. But· as he was only remarkable for feats of bodily strength, the
loss is not very confiderable.
