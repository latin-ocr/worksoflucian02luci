ICARo-MENIPPUS. 223

Thy parents

 

At this I thought Ishould have died with sear3 1 stood motionless, and
astonished at the awsulness and majesty of his voice; but recovering myself
in a short time, Ι related to him every thing from the beginning, how de-
firous l was of knowing sublime truths, how Ι went to the philosophcrs, and
hearing them contradi& one another, and driven to despair, thought on the
scheme of making me wings, with all that had happened in my journey
qui-te up to heaven. I then delivered the meffage to him from the Moon,
at which, sostening his contrait& brow, he smiled at me, and cried,
“ What were νζ* Otus and Ephialtes in comparison of Menippus, who hag
thus dated to fly up to heaven : but come, we now invite you to supper with
us, to-rnorrow we will attend to your business, and dismiss you.'' At these
words he rose up and went to that part of heaven where every thing from below
could be heard most distinffly3 for this, it seems, was the time appointed
to hear petitions. As we went along, he asked me several questions about
earthly mattets; such as, ‘⁴ How much corn is there at present in Greece?
had you a hard winter last year? and did your cabbages want rain? is any of
1Phidias’s family alive now? what is the reason that the Athenians have
left off sacrificing to me for so many years? do they think of building up
the Olympian temple again? are the thieves taken that robbed the Dodo·⁴
naean ?'' When 1 had answered all these, “ Pray, Menippus, said he, what
does mankind really think of me ?'’ “ How should they think of you, said l,
but with the utmost veneration, that you are the great sovereign of the gods.''
“ There you jest, said he; Ι arn sure, ljknotv well enough how fond they are

† Otus.] Otus and Ephialtes were two giants os an enormous size; some of the ancients,
who, uo doubt, were exa& in their measurement, ass‘nre us that, at nine years old, they were
nine cubits round, and thirty-six high, and grew in proportion, till they thought proper to at-
tack, and endeavour to dethrone Jupiter; for which purpose they piled mount Ossa and Pelion
upon Olympus, made Mars prisoner, and played several tricks of this kind, till Diana, by nr.
titice subdued them, contriving, some way or other, to make them shoot their arrows against,
and destroy each other, aster which Jupiter sent them down to Tartarus. Some attribute to

Apollo the honour of conquering thern. This story has been explained, and allegorized,
and tortnrcd so many different ways, that it is not easy to unravel the foundation ofit.
