ssAocHVUS.

The Critics os Lucrnn's Time, who had, perhaps, as little Tastefor true Humou73
as the Crilr'cs (ff our own, were perpetually finding fault with his Dialogues,
which they cotfiderecl as wild, romantic, and licetzti0u53 hls Altacks, theyfizitg
were furious, and his Manner conlemptible. In Answer lo some ⁰f thcst Cavils‚
it is probable, LucrAN sent out this little Traffz‘, in which, with an Ease and
Pleafimlty peculiar to him, he compares himself to BACCHUS attacking and defeat-⁸
ing the Indians, who had dtspistd and langhed at him and his Army. It is ob·
ftrvable, that whilst he makes '‘st’ of this Method to viudirale himself, he expsfis
the Abfizrdity eff the many ridiculous Storles which the Poets had heaped logelher‚
concerning one of [he fizvourlse Gods of Antiquily.

H EN Bacchus led forth his army against the Indians (for I see no

reason why I should not tell you a Bacchanalian story), the people
of that nation held him at first in the utmost contempt, laughed at his at-
tempt, and seemed, indeed, rather to pity his fastands, concluding that the
moment he began his artack, he would be immediately trod in pieces by
their elephantes. They had heard, we may suppose, strange things concern·
ing his army, that his troops were composed of mad women, crowned with
ivy, and covered with goat-fidus, carrying little wooden spears without iron,
and light ffiields, that founded hollow when you touched thern, like so
many drums: mixed with these, there were a few rustics, with horns and
tails like young kids‚ dancing the cordax 3 at the head of them their leader,
in a car drawn by leopards, a beardless boy, with scarce any down up-
on his chin, a bunch of grapes round his head, his hair tied up with a rib.
bon, a pair of horus, cloathed in purple, and in golden sandals. Under
him, two captains‚ ‘³‘ one of them a little ssrort old fellow, with a great belly,
andlong prick’d-up ears, flat-nosed, leaning on a staff, lhaking, and clad
in an old yellow coar, a proper assistant to such a general: the other, a large
man-{3 with lower parts like a goar, shaggy thighs, horns, and along beard,

ἃ One (farem, &c.] Silenus, the son of Pan, or as some tell uz, of Mercury; this extraor-
dinary grotesque figure was, it seems, a kind of tutor, or guardian to Bacchus, and afterwards
one of his generals. Vir-gil tells an agreeable story of him in his fixth eclogue, and Ovid ano λ
other in the eleventh book of his Metamorphoses.
