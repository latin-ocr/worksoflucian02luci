Will -you then listen to rne, my friend, whilst I defend dancing, and en·
deavour to convince you that it has many perfection53 that it isnot only enter-

harmonises the souls of the beholders‚ charms the fight with agreeable spec-
tacles, and the hearing with delightful sonnds, displaying the united beau-
ties both of mind and body : that it does all this by the affistance of mufic
and numbers, is not to its disgrace, bur. adds to the praise and honour of it.

’ I am not at leisure to hear a madman harangue in praise os his disternper;
but, if you are very defirous of pouring out your nonsense upon me, 1 will
submitto the operation, and lend you my ears, which, though [shall not
stop thern with wax, may not, perhap5‚ be very attentive to you. Ι will
hold my tongue, however3 therefore, say what you please, as if there was

nobody to overhear you.

That is the very thing I wished f0r3 you will soon see whether what l am
going to say to you is nonsense. In the first place, then, I must observe, that
you seem not to know the antiquity of dancing3 that it is not of yesterday,
not invented by our ancestors, nor by those who lived before them: they
who know the true origin of it will inform you, that it is coeval with the
birth of thtvUniverse, and spi-ang forth at the same time with Love, the el-

husband might not destroy the infant as soonv as born, which it seems he had threatened, retired
to Crete, when, after being delivered, ssie gave her little Jupiter to the cate of her friends, or
priests, the Curetes and Corybantes, who made a violent noise with their lances, ssrields, and
bucklers, that Saturn might not hear the child cry. Lucian takes this opportunity ot‘langhing
at the whole story, and tells us that it is therefore to dancing alone we are indebted for the
preservation of the father ofgods and men.
