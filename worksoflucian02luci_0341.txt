HipprAS. 335

marble‚ which leads you to an elegant apartment full of light, with three
warm baths in it: after bathing here, you need not go back through the
sarne rooms, but are comlue‘ced through a paffage made tolerably warni, and
very light, to the cold baths again: add to this, that the height, length,
and width, are all in the most exa& proportion to each other, and grace and
beauty preside through every part of the edifice. When you begin any
work, as Pindar says, you ssiould make the front splendid, and such as will
catch the eye ata distance, and in buildings particularly, regard should be
paid to the windows, and afine external appearance. Hippias, therei] re,
hath opened his cold baths to the north, for the benefit of the cool air, and
exposed those that want heat to the west and south. Need 1 mention the

rooms fit for exercise, the rooms to keep the cloaths in, not winding through
tiresome passages, but close to the baths, and equally calculated for health
and conveniency.

Some may, perhaps, think Ι bestow too magnificent encomiums on a work
of little consequence; but, in my opinion, to invent and execute new beau-
ties in common and ordinary matters, is no small mark of uncornmon and
extraordinary merit3 and such, I think, this work of Hippias, which has
all the good qualities of a bath, with regard to use, convenience, light,
symmetry, and proportion, well adapted to the soil and situation of the
place, and secure on every fide, with double doors to each soom, and pro-
per receffes, a water dial, anda sun dial. Whoever could behold such a
work, and with-hold the praises due to it, must, in my opinion, not only be
insensible‚ but envious and ungrateful also. For my own part, 1 have en-
deavoured, and 1 thought it my duty so to do, to celebrate and record by
this little remembrance of him, so excellent an artifices. If it should ever
happen‚ that Ι bathe again there, I doubt not but I ssiall meet with many
who willjoin with me in praise and admiration of it.
