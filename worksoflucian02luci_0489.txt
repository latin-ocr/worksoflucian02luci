how he hands the vietuals to the boy that stands behind him, not thinking
that he is seen by the company. Pray tell Lycinns, that he may take no-
tice of him·.'’ But there was no occasion for Ion’s pointing it out to mc,
as I had myself observed him some time before.

Scarce had Cleodemus said this, when in rulhed Alcidamas, the Cynic,

making use of the old adage; “ *Menelaus comes when he pleases.'' Many
people thought it very impertinent, and some muttered,

“ Thou ravest, Ο Menelaus.'’

Others cried out,
“ †The great Atrides likes not this”

 

Several hints of this kind were privately thrown out, but nobody ventured
openly to attack him, as he was one of the most noisy und petulant fellows
of the whole seit, insomuch that he intimidated every body ε Aristaenetus,
however, beckoned to, bade him take a chair, and fit down by Histiaeus
and Dionysodorus. “ No, no, (cried he,) no fitting in chairs, or laying on
couches, for me3 it is mean and effeminate to loll on couches, and crawl
on the ground, as you dn, and eat your vietuals with your purple garments
under you. I shall stand upright‚ and sup as Iwalk; and, whenI am tired,
lay me down in my cloak, and go to sseep.'' “ So you may, if you please,'’
said Aristaenetus3 and, accordingly, the Cynic walked all round, and took
his supper where he liked, changing his camp like the Scythians, stopping
wherever hc found the best pastore, and following the servants as they car-
ried [he meat about: in the mean time, whilst he was eating, he did not
forget to disaute about the nature of virtue and vice, and to talk about his
contempt of riehes; alked Aristsenetus what he did with so many fine gold
,and filver cup-f , when wooden ones would have been just as useful : as soon,
however, as he began to grow troublesome, Aristaenetus quitted him, by
making signs to the boy to give him a large cup oswine, and make it pretty
strong: this, he thought, was doing a great thing, little imagining how

⁸ Menelaus, &ej *Alluding to that passage in the second book of the -lliad, where lt is said,
speakIng of Agamemnon’s feast,

Menelaus came, numo, the last.

From this circumstance, as related by Homer, trifling as it may appear, when any body came
to a feast, uninvited, he was called a Menelaus: and this, it seems, was the ease with the
Cynic Alcidamas.
