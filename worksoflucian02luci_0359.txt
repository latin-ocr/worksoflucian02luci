ILLITERATEBOOK-HUNTER. 35:

for it? certainly no; your nod affents to it: grant me then this also, when ,ι
man, illiterate like you, buys a number of books, is it not vn'y laughing at
himself, and publishing his own ignorance and incapacity Ρ why won’t
you nod at this? the thing is equally clear, and every flander-by uill cry
out in the usual style, ἦ what has a dog to do with a bath!

Not long agO, there was a rich man in Afia, who had the missortune to
lose both his feet, which, in a journey through the snow, were eat offby
exceffive cold weather. Such was his miserable condition, which he endeaae
voured to relieve, by getting a pair of wooden ones, which were fastened on
to his legs, though he waS, at the same time, obliged to be carried about
by his servants; and yet he was always ridiculous enough to be purchafing
new and costly lhoes, and took a great deal of pains to have the finest wooden
feet he could procure. And are not you doing the very farne thing, who
have a lame and wooden mind, and yet are constantly purting it into golda-ri
sandals, which scarce any one, whose feet are ever so well, can make shift
to walk in ?

As, 1 doubt not, but amongst your numerous volumes, you have bought
a Homer, let somebody, I desire, take the second book and read it to you,
(for, as to the rest, they are nothing to you, and you need not look into
them,) there you will find the description of a -f ridiculous, poor, distorted
fellow, haranguing the people. Now, would this same Thersites, think
you, if he were to put on the armour of Achilles, become immediately
valiant and beautifu13 would he tinge the Trojan rivers with blood, ssay Ly-
caon and ‡ Asteropaeus, who was not able to wield Achilles’s spent, and af-
terwards destroy Hector himself? you never can suppose it. &Vould he
not rather be laughed at, when he was seen limping under the ssiield, finking
down beneath the weight of the helmet, rolling about his goggle eyes, raifing
up the breast-plate with his crooked ssioulders, and dragging his heavy boots

† Arffliculous, &ad Alluding to the charaerer of Thersites, as drawn by Homer in the seu

· Loquacious, bold, and turbulent of tongue,
Aw’d by no shame, by no respe& controul’d‚
ln scandals busy, in reproaches bold ς
With witty mallee, studious to defame,
Scorn all his joy, and laughter all his aim.
