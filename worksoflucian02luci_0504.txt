which the Greeks tell concerning this Deucalion is as follows: “ the present
racc os rnen is not the same as that which formerly inhabited the earth, who
all perished; the generation now before us all sprung from Deucalion, who
renewed mankind. Those who lived before the deiuge, were, as history in-
forms υς, proud and haughty, and committed all 2³, kinds of wickedness; they
neither adhered to their oaths‚ nor were hospitable to strangers, nor spared

the suppliant; and for these things a heavy judgment came upon thern.
The earth on a sudden poured forth great water5‚ the rains descendat, the

rivers swelled, the sea rose toa prodigious height3 every thing was covered
with water, and all mankind perished. Deucalion alone was reserved to

raise up another race, on account of his piety and goodness. He was saved
in this manner : he shut up his wives and children in a large ark‚ and went
himself into it; and, as soon as he was entered, there carne unto him boars,
horses, lions, serpents, and every other creature that feedeth upon the earth,
all in pairs, and he received them all; nor did they hurt each other, but
harmony and friendship, by the »ᾗ divine command, prevailed amongst them z
and thus they all sailed together, in the same ark‚ as long as the waters

xergtailcxifcis the story which the Greeks tell concerning Deucalion. Another

sa& of a most extraordinary nature is related by the people of Hierapolis,
who tell us, that they have there a large chasm, or opening, which received

in any. heathen writer, as it most remarkably corresponds with, aud confirms, the Mosaic hiv'
ilory. The place of Lucian's nativity was (as the learned Bryant remarks) a part ofthe world
where memorials of the deluge were particularly preserved, and where a reference to that history
is conrinually to be observed in the rites and worship os the country ε his knowlege, therefore,
was obtained from the Afiaric iratior-rs, among whom he was born, and not from his kinsmen the
helladiam, who were far inferior in the knowlege of ancient times. Bryant has colleeted a
variety os ancient records of this event, to which I refer the curious reader. See Bryant’a
Ans-lysis, vol. ii. p. 214, διο.

j: All kinds, &tal Agreeable to what the scripture says: “ The earth was corrupt before
God, and the earth was filled with violence: and God looked upon the earth, and behold it
was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.” Genesis, chap. vi. ver.

† Dima [emmaum] The ark‚ or chest, as Bryant observes, in which Noah and his family
were secured, was of such a rnodel and conffluftion, as plainly indicated, that it was never de-
figued to be managed or direffited by the hands of men : and it seems to have been the purpose
os Providence throughout, to signisy to those who were saved, as well as to their latest postersty,
that their preservation was not, in any degree, effeeted by human means. See the Analyfis,
vol. ii. p. 197⁶
