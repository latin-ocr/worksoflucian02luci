Ou THESYRIANGODDESS. 503

arrived at Hierapolis they began the building of the temple, in which they
were employed during the space of three years: in the mean time, that
came to pass which Combabus had so much dreaded; Stratonice fell in love
with him, ,coneeiving a violent paffion, which rose almost to madness. The
inhabitants of Hierapolis attribute it to Juno, who inspired her with it, in
revenge for her having so long deferred the building of the temple. For
some time she modestly concealed her inclination, but the disorder increased
so as to deprive her of all rest and peace : she fighed and wept for whole days
together, till at length, unable any longer to hide, she resolved to take the
first opportunity of discovering it to him 3 {he could not disclose it to another,
and -yet fhame prevented her acknowleging it to Combabus. It then occur-
ed to her that the freedom of a public banquet, where wine inspires bold-
ness, and every thing is attributed to the festival, might plead her excuse.
She provided one therefore, and after supper came into the chamber where
he laid, fell on her knees, and openly avowed her paffion for him: but he
treated her with coldness and disdain, and even told her such indecent warmth
must have proceeded from intemperance. She then grew indignant, and
threatened to punish him severely for his indifference ; this so alarrned and
terrified him, that he at once told her the whole truth of the matter, and
what had happened to him. When she had heard this melancholy tale,
which she so little expected, her rage snbfided 2 but love still remained, and
she continued to ndmire, and keep company with him. It is remarkable
thata pallion ofthis kind still subfists at Hierapolis; the women are fond of
the priests, and the priests ὴὲ mad after the women3 nobody entertains any
Ι jealousy on the account, and it is looked upon amongst them as a kind of
religious phrenzy.

The king, however, was soon acquainted with the familiarity between his
wife and Combabus, and therefore, though the work‚.was still unfinissted,
sent for him home. A report prevailed, but a very improbable one, that
Stratonice, on being repulfed, had written to her husband, accusmg Com·
babus of an attempt to debauch her. The Affyrians attributing to her the
same conduct which, according to the Grecians, Phaedra and Sthenobaea
were guilty of: though Ι cannot, for my own part, believe that Sthenobaea,
or Phaedra, if {he really loved Hippolytus, ever behaved in that manner:
be that however as it may, when the:¹ meffenger cameto Hierapolis, for

ἱ* Asad, δα] One would think Lucian was here describing a modern univerfity.
