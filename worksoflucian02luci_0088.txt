from her country and her ancestors: nor is it surprifing that {be ffiould be
fond of poetry, who is a native of that *⁴* place which gave birth to Homer.
Thus much for her voice, both with regard to speaking and finging. I shall
now proceed to her other perfection53 and here, I do not intend, like you,
to mingle all the beauties together, to make one complete model, but to
describe at large every virtue of her mind, and refer them fingly and separ-
ately to this great original.

You invite me, Polystratus, to a noble feast indeed, and seem resolved to

give me, as 1 defired, full measure3 pour away, therefore, as fast as you
please, you cannot do me a greater favour.

POLYSTRATUS.

As knowlege then, particularly that which arises from study and contem·
plation, is, doubtless, of all human perfefifions the most defirable, let us
take it in all its various forms, that our model may be as complere as your’s.
Let her, therefore, have all the gifts of Helicon, not as Clio, Polyhymnia,
or Calliope, and the rest ; each poffeffing one, but endowed with thern all, to-
gether with those of Mercury and Apollo. Adorned with whatever poets
have feigned, historians recorded, or philosophers taught3 these she must
be perse& mistress of, not moistened only by this dyc, but totally tinged
and saturated with it. Of this, indeed, 1 can produce no living example,
nor recolleet one, even in the stores of antiquity. Such, however, let our
portrait remain3 you will thinkit, perhap8, no poor or contemptible one.

lt is, indeed, most excellent, and comprehends every point of perfectiora,

POLYSTRATUS.

Let us now produce the portrait of wisdorn and prudence: and here, Ῑ
shall want many examples, particularly from the ancients: amongst whom,
Issiall sele& Socrates and his friend AEschines, the most skilful of all artists,
who painted with peculiar energy and grace. As the best model of prudence,
we will take Aspafia of Miletus, who· lived with the famous Pericles, and
was so renowned for her knowlege and acutenefs in all civil affairs3 for quick—
ness of parts, penetration, and sagacity. These we will all transfer to our

own portrait, though one is but a small picture, the other aColoffus in com.-
parison with her.
