220 ICARO-MENIPPUS.

rather fingcrs were met together, and every one was ordered to leave the cho·
rus, and sing his own song, each striving to drown the others voice, by
bawling as loud as he could 3 you may imagine what kind of a concert this

And yet ²³ such, my friend, are all the poor performers upon earth, and
os such is composed the discordant music of human life; the voices not only
diflbnant and inharmonious‚ but the forms and habits all differing from each
other, moving in various directions, aud agreeing in nothing, till at length
the great ψ master of the choir drives every one of them from the stage,
and tells him heis no longer wanted there; then all are silent, and nolonger
distutb each other with their harsh and jarring discord. But in this wide and
extensive theatre, full of various ihapes and forms, every thing was matter
of laughter and ridicule: above all, I could not help smiling at those who
quarrel about the boundaries of their little territory, and fancy themselves
great because they occupy a 'g Sicyonian field, or possess that part of Mara-
thon which bordei-s on Oenoe, or are masters of a thousand acres in Achar-

fingers in breadth, and Attica a very small portion of it indeed. 1 could not

the most extensive country owned a spot that appeared to me about' as large
as one of Epicurus's atoms. When Ι looked down upon Peloponnesus, and be-

Lacedaemonians who fell in one day, fighting for a piece of land no bigger
than an Higyptian lentile; and when 1 saw a man brooding over his gold,
and boasting that he had got four cups or eight rings, Ilaughed most heartily

goii: ; the Argives and Spartans, whom it laid between, agreed to decide the property of it by
three hundred men os a side in the field : the battle was bloody and desperate, only one man re-
maining alive, Othryades, the Lacedaemonian‚ who immediately, though covered with wouuds,
raised a trophy, which he inscribed with his own blood, to Jupiter Tropaeus. This victory
the Spartans, who stom that time had quiet poll‘effion ofthe field, yearly celebrated with a festi-
val, to commemorate the event.
