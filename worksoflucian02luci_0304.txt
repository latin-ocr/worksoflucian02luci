298 On MOURNING roa ‘rua DEAD.

didst thou marry or have childrcn; never didst thou fight for thy country, οι
till the earth, or arrive at old age; never again, my child, ffialt thou keep
company, never {halt thou fall in love, never shalt thou get drunk with thy
companions.'' This, or something like this, will the foolilh father say, as is
he thought he could stand in need ofthese things after death, and would not
be able to get them. But this is nothing; some 1 have known ridiculous
enough on the death of their relations, to kill their horses, their women,
and their ssaves, to burn along with thern their apparel, and bury their fur-
niture, as thinking they may have occafion for them below. But the old
man Ι mentioned, whatever he might say with a tragical voice, did not do it
for his son's sake, who, he very well knew, could not hear him, though he
roared like stent0r3 nor was it for his own, as the sentiment would have
done just as well without being expreffed‚ and nobody need talk to them-
selves; it must be therefore only to'please others, and because it is the fastiion,
as he could not posfibly tell where his son was going, or whether his death
was really a misfortune or not.

Might not the son, therefore, having begged leave of AEacus and Pluto to
peep from the door of his prison, thus have reproved the father for his idle
complaints, “ Wherefore, good old man, art thou so unhappy and disquiet-
ed ? Why dost thou trouble me with thy lamentations; leave off tearing thy
hair, and cutting thy flesh3 why dost thou call me wretched, when Iam
much hippier than thyself? dost thou think it a misfortune to me that I arn
not like thee, old, haggard, and withered, and rusty, with a bald pate, and
wrinkled face, bent down with age, and weak hams, after such a number
ofOlympiads, thatare but so many witneffes of thy folly ; what is there in
lise so valuable that 1 should here regret the loss of it? Eating and drinking,
¹vou will say, fine cloathS, and fine women; and fearest thou that I ssiall be
wretched for wantos these? Knowest thou not that never to be thirsty is
better than to drink, never to be hungry than to eat, never to want cloaths
than to have the greatest plenty of them?

‘¹ But l will tell you, for you seem not to know, why you should lament3
once more begin your complaints, and cry out, ‘⁶ Wretched son, uo longer
ssialt thou he hungry or dry, no longer shalt thou mourn, no longer dread
disorders, severs, enemies, or tyrants, no longer shall love or paffion torment
thee, no longer shalt thou stuffthyself two or three times a day, nor fflalt
thou grow old and despised, or thy presence be detested by the young and

gay.”
