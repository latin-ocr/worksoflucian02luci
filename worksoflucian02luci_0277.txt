TmPARASITE. 27¹

he goes out to fight, as * Ulyffes prescribes, take his breakfast Ρ
for, whomsoever he commanded to fight, him he first invited to feast, let
him begin ever so early : whilst other soldiers spend their time in a cowardly
manner, some in fitting on their helmets, others preparing their-breast-plates,
others in trembling for the event of the battle; he with a chearful counte·

must suppose them to be so many malefaetors let out of prison for lack of
better soldiers to fight for their country ! Such, my friend, are parafites in
time of war, compared to your orators and philosophers; in peace they are
as preferable to thern as peace itself is to war; and to prove this, we will
first, if you please, consider the situations of peace.

TYCHIADES.

Most undoubtedly.

To the forum, or court of justice then, our parafite never comes, because
they are fitter for informers and petty-foggers, seldom any thingjust or

honest is carried on there ; the palaestra indeed, the gymnafium, and the ban-⁷

And those augment by gen'rous wine and f00d;
Dismiss the people then, and give command,
With strong repast to hearten ev'ry band,
