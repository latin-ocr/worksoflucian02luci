ONCALUMNY. 37¹

hear him, perhaps, and simle, as if he approvcd; but, at the same time,
gnash with his teeth, and inwardly hate and detest him; burying his anger,
as the ᾗ poet says, deep in his breast. Nothing, at the same time, can bc
more base or unjust than to bite the lip, nourish secret resentrnent, and kccp
our hatred thus shut up within, to Τ think one thing and say another, to
play the hypocrite, and under a comic mask to a& a tragic part full of death
and horror.

And this generally happens when the calumniator bas been formerly the
friend of him whom he accuses; then they will not suffer the man even to

speak or defend himself, because, they imagine, from the accuser's long fa-
miliarity with him, that the accusation must be founded on truth ; not con-

fidering, that amongst the greatest friends, causes of quarrel and separation
may arise unknown to others. Sometimes a man will accuse another of that
crime which he is, himself, guilty of, the better to avoid all suspicion of it.
Nobody, for the most part, ventures to ssander an avowed enemy3 so that
Calumny seldom meets with credit, which has so visible and manifest a cause:
it is always the seeming friend who attacks, who thus sstews his extraordi-
nary regard for the hearer, as to his interest and advantage, he sacrifices his
best and dearest friend. Ι have even known some, who, on discovering that
their friends had been unjustly accused, have been so ashamed of their own

> credulity, that they would never look upon, or admit them again, entirely
breaking offwith thern, as if they had done thern an injury, by proving

their innocence.
Thus, by giving ear to Calumny without trial or examination, is human

life subje& to innumerable calamities. Antaea, we know, cried out to Praetus,

Or die thyself, or take thy rival’s life,
Bellerophon, who tempts they faithful wife.

After {he had, herself, puthis virtue to the trial, and been repulsed : whilst
the young man was very near being destroyed by the Chimaera, and the re·
