THE

‘PARASITQ

ADIALOGUE.

Under the Mcffk osa grave and laboured Encomium on the Art or Mystery of P arafitism,
univeyfhthpraHifi’d in LuemN’s time, and not uncommon in our own, we have
here a severe Satire on the Profiffirs of it. T he Moriae Encomium, or Praise of
Folly, by Erasmus, was, probabgy² suggested to him by this very entertainiszg
Dialogue, which is written is an easy unqffeb'z‘ed Siste, and zf it doth not make
the Reader finile, he mzfst either have no rffible Mtst'les, or knows not how, or
when, to make use of them. Our Author follows the Socratic Method ofDisput-
ing, made Use of by Socrates ; who, as κ’ Addison observes, “ introduced the
catechetical Mode ofarguing, offking his Adversary Qnstion upon Qcstion, till he
had convinced him out of his own math, that his Opinions were wrong. This
way of Debating (he obfhrves‚) drives an Enemy up into a Corner, fi’lzes all the
Pcffis through which he can make his Estape, and forces him to surrender at Dis-

cretion.”

OW comes it to pasS, Simo, that whilst all mankind, freemen or

ssaves, exercise some art which is profitable both to themselves and ro
others also, you seem to have no employment that can be·0f service, either

to yourself, or to any body else ?

1 do not rightly understand your question, Tychiades; I beg you would

be more explicit. .

instance, understand rnufic? S I M O

By Jupiter, notat all.
