ground, as it is not lawful for him to go into a bed till his journey is finished,
and he is returned to his own home.

At Hiera-polis, there is a public officer appointed to receive strangers,
who flock there from all parts : these are of every country, and are called
by the Afl'yrians Teachers‚ as their business is to teach and instruct their
countryrnen the mysteries celebrated here. The victims are never sacrificed
in the temple, but, after being offered at the altar, are taken home alive,
Κ and ssain there; to this succeed the prayers of the sacrificer.

There is likewise another method of sacrificing3 when the victim being
crowned with garlands‚ is thrown down headlong from the porch of the
temple, and dies by falling on the rocks below ε some have thrown down
their children from this place, wrapping them up in a bag, and denouncing
curses against them, saying, at the same time, that they were not children,
but oxen-

All here ψ mark themselves with red hot iron; some on the palms of
their hands, others on their necks; and there is not an Affyrian here with·
out some mark or other. They have another custom here, in which they
have been followed by the Trezenims, the only Greeks who practise it.
The young men and maidens among them never marry, without first cut-
ting off and offering up their hairto Hippolytus: this they do also at Hiera-
polis, where the young men leave their beards after the first tirne of ssmving
them. They likewise put their hair into boxes of gold or filver, which they
offer up in the temple ε all then leave their name upon it, and depart. This
Ι did myself, wheanas a young man : my hair, and my name with it, are

still in the temple.

heite, as described by captain Cook. See his Voyage.
