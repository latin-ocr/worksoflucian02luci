JUPITERCONFUTED. 149

is in the power ofthe Fates‚ and nothing which they have decreed, can by
any means be reversed 3 why should we mortals bring our hecatombs and sa-

crifices to> you, or '¹⁵ put up prayers for bleslings from you ? for my part, I see
no advantage that can result from it, if our praycrs can neither avcrt evil,

nor procure good for us from the divine Being.

J U P 1 T E R.

I know where you pick up your subtle argument33 fr01n4hose cursed so-

pffists, who deny our providence, and, not content with afking these impious

questions, diffuade others from praying or sacrificing to us, telling them, it

is all in vain, for that we take no care about earthly things, nor are able to
do any thing for mankind : but they shall not long rejoice in their iniquity.

I swear, Jupiter, by Clotho's shuttle‚ it was not any thing which they said
that makes me talk [ος but it seems to follow from your own confcffion,
that sacrifices are rather superfluou53 for let rne ask you only one thing, do

not be angry now, but answer me.

R.
well, if you have nothing ellseltonoEbut. to prate about these things,

CYNISCUS.

Every thing, you say, is determined by the Fates ?
J U P 1 T E R.

Certainly. C Y N 1 S C U S

And is it in your power to change, or annul it?

JUPJTER.

By nomeans.
C Y N 1 S C U S.

Need Ι mention the consequence then, or is not it plain enough without
my saying any thing about it?
J U P 1 T E R.
Itis plain enoughindeed ε but those who sacrifice to us, do it not through
want, but out of gratitude for benefits received, as paying for what they
have had of us, and frorn reverence of their superiors.

† Put up, &c.] This, to abeliever in predestination is, it must be acknowleged, a ssirewd
argument, and to say the truth, not eafily refuted·
