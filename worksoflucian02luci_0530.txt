524 ENcoM1UM on DEMOSTHENES„

to his own country, Ι would give that man my money, but not my friend-
ship; but if, sor his country’s sake, 116 hares and opposes me, I would at-
tack him as [would his naval arumnicum, the walls and bulwarks of his
city ; though, at the same time, 1 admire his virtue, and think that kingdom
happy, which can boast of such a defcnder, 1 would dcstroy the place, and
all that belongs to it: but Ι would rather have him on our fide, than the
Triballi, the lllyrian horsemen, or all the mercenary troops which we could
hire; as 1 would prefer the power of eloquence, and the wisdom of good
councils, to the strength of armies, and all the force of military prepa-
ration.’'

Thus did he speak to Parmenio, and frequently would he talk to me in
the same style: once, in particular, I remember, when Iseemed uneasy,
and displeased at his sending Diopithes to Athens : “ Are you afraid (said
he, laughing,) of what Athenian leaders, or their armie53 can do against
us? their piraeus, their harbours, their fleets and armies, I despise: what
can a set of Bacchanals do, who live in the midst of songs and festivals ? if
Demosthenes alone were absent, we should more easily take the city than by
all we could do, either with force or fraud, to gain over the Thebans and
Theffaliaiis ε but he is for ever watchful‚ seizing every opportunity to relist
our attacks, and, by his counsels alone, renders fruitless all our operations ι
try what we will, design what we will, a& as we will, we cannot escape him.
In a word, this man is the sole obstacle to our conquest and success; and, if
hc had been present, we should not have taken Amphipolis or Olynthus,
Pylae, Chersonesus, nor any thing which we possess round the Hellespont,
He stirs up his sellow-citizens, even against their will ε when they are lulled‚
ns it were, to sleep, by mandragora, he rouses them from their lethargy‚
and, with his eloquence, burns up and destroys their indolence, little soli-
citous of their favour or affection: he applies the profits of the theatre to
the support os the army, and reformed the corrupt state of the navy by sa.
lntary laws: the dignity of the empire, which, for a long time, had been
miserably impaired, he hath restored: 116 hath called them back to a re·
membrance of their ancestors, and a noble emulation of what passed at
Marathon and Salamis : he is perpetually forming new alliances, and treaties,
with the states of Greece ε it is as impossible, in short, to conceal any thing
from, to deceive, or corrupt him, as it was for the Persian king to bribe
Aristides. This man, therefore, Antipater, is more to be dreaded than

all.
