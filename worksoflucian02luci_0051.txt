clance! where you observe their various turns and modons, the bendings and
writhings· of the body, which at the same time that they are entertaining to
the spedtator, are wholsome and salutary also to the performer3 for th,- xer-
eise is both healthful and hemming, that bends and supples the limbs, makes
thern fitter to bear any change, and gives them no small strength and firmness,

What then can be said against an art so universally excellent, which
ss1-arpens the mind, exercises the body, delights the speetator, teaches the
knowlege of antiquity, and pleases both the eye and ear, amidst the har-
mony of flutes‚ cymbals, harps, and songs: if the modulations of the voice
att'raet you, where will you find sweeter harmony? or, if you take delight
iu rnufic’s still more enchanting sounds, in our art you will have enough os
both. Pfforneed 1 add, thatthisentenahunentiniprovesthe naannersalstQ
for we always* find the stage detesting and abhorring every thing that is evil,
sympathizi-ng with the oppreffed, and in every respee‘c inculcating moralsty,
and the condu& of the speetators. Most praise-worthy it is, in this arr, that
it promotes both the* strength and agility oftthe limb53 the force of Hercules⁹
and the delicacy of a Venus, are at once exhibited by it.

I will now describe to you what a good dancer should be, both with re*
gard to mind and body: the former I have already touched upon, and ob-
served that he should have a fine genius and an excellent memory, a ready
wit, and good understanding‚ knowing how to make the best of every thing;
with a critical judgment of poetry‚ able to distinguish the best songs and
verses, and to rejeet what is bad.

With regard to his body, it should be according to the rules laid down
by Polycletes ; he should not be exceffively tall, nor too short like a dwarf,
but of a true and proper height3 not fat and bulky, for that can never be
agreeable, nor, on the other hand, so thiu, as to be like a carcase, or a
skeletou.

The people of Antioch, a‘ very ingenious and senfible narion, who are
very fond of dancing, and so nice in their observations that nothing escapes
them, made the following remarks: a * little man one day performing the
part of Hector, they cricd out, this is Astyanax3 where is his father? an-

prin of othello. Ι see the little black boy, said he, but where is the tea-kettle ?—It is butjns⁴²

tice to add, that Garrick played the part of Othello (though it was not his finest chara-ieter), in-
finita-ly better than th.

other.
