ENCOMIUM oNAFLY. 349

’ἕ Musca, as the fable tells us, was once a most beautiful woman, lively,
talkative‚ and an excellent finger, who rivallcd the Μυκη) in her love to En-
dymion3 she teized the youth, as he ssept, with her song-32· and tales, till he was
offended, when Luna changed her into a ssy- Still nnndl'ul of Endymion,
she disturbs the rest of young men, and will not let then] lleep3 her biting,
and thirst of blood, is a mark not of anger, but of love; ssie feeds on benum,
and enjoys as much of it as {he can.

There was arnongst the ancients a † poetess of this name, beautiful, τι· d
learned3 and, likewffe, a noble courtesan of Athens, os whom the cornio
poet says, “ this Musca has bit him to the hea1·t.’' Thus, we see, the comic
Muse has adopted her3 nor are parents asharned of calling their daughters
by that name: ἶ tragedy also mentions her with honour.

With wondrous ardour springs the daring fly,
Fixes on man, and thirsts for human blood3
Whilst the arrn'd warrior dreads his pow'rful dart.

Icould say a great deal about §Pythagoras's fiy, but the ssory is too

well known.

There is a kind of large flies, which some call the fighting or dog-flies,
who make a dreadful noise, and fly with surprifing swiftness ; these are very
long—lived, and remain all the winter without food, hiding themselves in the
roofs of houses; it is remarkable, that these are all a kind of hermaphrodires,

both male and female.
Ihad a great deal more to say on this subje&‚ but I will leave off,
lest, as the proverb says, ΙΙ Out ofa fly, I should make an elephant.

Ἃ· This pretty fable of Musca is much in the Ovidian ssyle. A verfion of it into Latin
hexameter-s would be no bad exercise for a school-boy of taste and geniusv Ι would recom-
mend it to some of my brother iVestrninsteis as a proper subjedt to try their lkill upon.

ἦ· Apoetess.] See Olearius’s Differtation on the Fernale Poets ofGreece.

ἶ Tragedy] What tragedianwhese lines are quoted from we know not. The commentator
says, Euripidem haee sapere videntur; but gives no reason for it.

ξ &thagoras’sspq Musca, or Myra. the daughter of Pythagoras, by Theano; was married
to Milo the Crotonian. On this palinge of Lucian, Menage, in his History or Female I'hilo-
sopher8‚ has this note, “ Lucianus, (says he,) in Muscae encomio addit multa de Musca Py-
thagorica hodie haec historia ignoratur.”

ῃ Out ofasty, &eq To make an elephant of a fly, was a kind of proverb, probably of the
same import, and correspondent with our own of “ Making mountains ofmolehills.''
