red of you, even the women, it seems, know your charactem for, but the
>other day, when you wanted to get you a wife at Cyzicus, the woman, who
was well acquainted with all your pranks‚ said, ·“ J shall hardly take one for
a husband, who seems to want a husband himself-'⁹

And aster all this, do you ,pretend to criticise, and find fault with others?
but you certainly have a right, for we can, none of us, talk like you: who
would venture as you did, to ask sor a trident instead of a sword, to kill three
adulterers? or,·when talking of Theopompus's judgment of Tricaranus,
would say, he destroyed the principal cities with a three-pointed oration, or
that he had tridented Grecce, and was a ,Cerberus in language3 with abun-
dered other absurdities of this kind, which are not worth †repeating. ’ὅ ³³

What poverty might, perhaps, havedriven you to, I shall pass over, nor
would Ι reproach any body sor it z ifa man receives a certain ,depofit from a
friend, and should afterwards, being ‚hals-starved, swear that he never re-

them, I say nothing, it would be cruel t0 rob a poor man of his bread3 but,
for this same poor mah to squander away the fruits of his dishonest dealing

ᾗ thirty aurei, who paid hisrfive hundred and fifty drachmas with pleasure,
{or a book recommended to him by so renowned a sophist.

Ihad a great deal moreto say, but‚1ha11 spare you for the present, and
only give you this advice : in your drunken srofics, do what you please to
yourself, -but trouble me no more3 there is no being under the sarne mog
or eating and drinking with such fellows as you; and, above all, letus have
none of your kiffes‚ which are rather what one may call Apophras, ill-ornen-
ed, and unlucky: let me advise you withal, never more to perfume your
bald pate3 is you are ill, you must take care of your old body, but if not,
what signifies [ampering with it for the vilest purposes; grey hairs are a bad

,ἧ- Repeasing] Two or three lines are here omitted, containing verbal criticisms on some ab·
surd phrases and expreffions made use of by Timarchus in his speech, which, as confined to the
Greek language, and the pronunciation of it, could not be transsated.

θ Ttfias] One of the first sophists‚ as mentioned by Aristode, mga ιλεγχωι σοφις mm.

ξ, Rooked.] Tisias, who wrote a book on rhetoric, was a disciple of Corax, on which name fi
pun will be found in the original by the learned reader, which is n'ot quite lost in the transsa„

ξ ‘Thirty aunei] Which is the same as five hundred and fifty drachmas,
