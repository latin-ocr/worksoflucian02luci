POLYSTRATUS.

Are you sure, rny friend, you have omitted nothing in the composition of

your beauty?
L Y C 1 N U S.

Not that Ι know of, unless, perhaps, you think it cannot be complete
without the proper colouring3 there, indeed, we must be deficient3 for how
shall we procure it? Shall we call in all those painters who are famous for
blending their colours with taste and judgment, Polygnotus, Euphranor,
AEtion, and Apelles? let these divide the talk. Euphranor shall lend us
his Juno’s hair, Polygnotus the handsorne eye-brow, and rosy cheeks of his
Delphian Cass'andra : he too {hall furnish us with a robe of the finest work,
most ofit flowing in loose folds, and only succinet where it ought to be so.
The rest ofthe·b0dy we will take from the * Pacata of ApelleS, with a [kin
not too pale and fair, but shewing the ἦν blood within. ,ἶ AEti⁷)n shall give
us the lips of his Roxana: we will borrow from Homer too, that best of
painters, even in the presence of Euphranor and Apelles, the thighs os
Menelaus, which he compares to §ivory stained with purple, will suit
her also; he shall give her the eyes: the Η Theban poet too shall affist,
and lend us his even brows; and Maeonides shall make her 4 white
arm’d, and rosy-finger'd, far more like golden Venus than¹his Briseis.

Α Thus far the statuary, the painter, and the poet may be of service to us;
but forthat grace which is diffused through every part, or rather all the

by AElian, und who, as Pliny tells us, was the same as Campaspe, the celebrated beauty, and
mistress or* Alexander the Great, whom Apelles fell in love with as he was drawing her picture.

ξ Ιοοζγ.] As when some stately trappings are decreed,
To grace a monarch on his bounding steed,
A nymph in Caria, or Maeonia bred,
Staius the pure iv’ry, with a lively red.
With equal lustro various colours vie,
The ssiining whiteness of the Tyrion ἆγες
So, great Atrides, show’d thy sacred blood,
And, down thy snowy thigh, distill’d the streaming blood'.
