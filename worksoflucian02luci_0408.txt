THE

LOVEoF oURCOUNTRY,.

This is a Kind of public Exercifi’ or Declamation‚ probably spoken by Lucum him-
st’lf, or written by him for one of his Pupils, when he appeared in the Charalfier
qf an Orator or Rhetorician. There is nothing very new or entertaining in this
fhort Piece: on a Subje& sb trite and hackneyed, one can no more expe& Wit
or Humour, than in a Birth qu Ode. Hus'rws will not allow it to be Lv-

cxnn’s.

T is an old adage, that nothing is more pleafin'g and delightful to every
man than his own country; may we not add, that nothing is more
venerable or more divine? for, surely, of whatever is noble, whatever is di-
vine, our country is the first cause, the great mistress, who taught, who en·

couraged‚ and who brought it to perfectiori. Many admire the extent, the
splendour, and magnificence of other cities, but all love their own z no man,

be he ever so fond of fine fi-ghts abroad, is so led away or enchanted by them,
as to forget his own home. He who boasts of being born in a most noble
and illustrious country, seems not to know the duty ofa citizen ; as, were it

less illustrious, he would esteetn it less3 but our own country, be it what it
will, should be honoured and esteemed by us. When we compare cities-
one with another, we confidet· the fize, beauty, and commercia! advantages
uf each : but, at the same tirne, no man would leave his own for the most

splendid of them, but prefer it to all, though he might with it were near to
the most convenient and delightful. For thus it is with regard to good
parents and dutiful children3 no honest or virtuous young man prefers an-
other to his father, nor will the good father embrace another child and negle&
his own. On the other hand, so attached are parents to those who spring
from thern, that their own children always appear the best, the rnost beauti—
ful, and the most accomplished3 and he who judges not thus of his son,
seems not, to me, to have the eyes of a father.

One of the nearest and dearest of all names, is that of father, and so,
doubtless, is that of our country: if we pay all honour and respect to a fa-
ther, as nature and the laws require of us 3 to our country we owe still greater,
