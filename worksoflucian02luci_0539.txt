What you say about the AEgyptians is true enough3 it is shameful and
abominable: but most of these are only mysterious and hieroglyphical, and
you, who are not of the initiated‚ should not laugh at them.

There is no great mystery in finding out that gods are gods, and dog's-

heads, dogs-heads.

We113 say no rnore about the AEgyptianS, we shall confidet of them at

There is Trophonius, and, which hurts me still more, Amphilochus:
that son of a wicked parricide, is perpetually telling lies in Cilicia, and pro-
