ΟΝ THE DEATH OF PEREGRINUS. 437

to bear his impertinence, drove him away; observing, very properly, that
the people did not stand in need of such a philosopher. This, however,
made him more sought after, as it was soon in every body's mouth, that a
philosopher was banished for his freedom of speech, and the love of truth
and liberty. This raised him to a rivalship with ‘r' Musonius, † Dion, Epic-
tetus, and others, who had met with the same fate, .

When he went from thence into Greece, he abused the inhabitants of Elis;
endeavoured to persuade the Grecians to revolt against the Romans3 took
upon himself severely to censure a person eminent for his rank and learning;
who, amongst other things which he had done for the public good, had
brought water to Olympia, for the benefit of the speetators, who, before,
were perishing with thirst3 this man he was perpetually railing against, as
one who corrupted the Grecians, and made those effeminate, who, at the
public games, should be able to bear thirst and every other hardship:
whereas he had, in reality, preserved thousands from innumerable disorders,
occasioned by the dryness of the soil, and the immense quantity of people
crouded together: add to this, that he drank himself of this water, whilst
he abused the man who brought it3 when, at length, the populace rose,
and were going to stonc him, he escaped by flying to Olympian Jove.

Four years afterwards, at the next Olympiad, he produced an oration in
praise of the tuan who had brought the water, with an apology for his own
condu&; but, at length, growing into disrepute‚ he was taken but little
notice of, for all his tricks were now obsolete3 and having nothing new
to amuse them with, or by which he could acquire same, he thought, at
last, of this funeral pile, and accordingly gave out amongst the Grecians,
that he should burn himself upon it in a very short time: for this purpose he
began immediately to dig the ditch, bring the wood, and prepare every
thing with wonderful fortitude and magnanimity. But true bravcry, in my
opinion, is shewn by patiently waiting for death, and not in flying from life;
or, if he must die, why not depart by some other means, so many thousands
as there are, and not by fire, and with all that tragical preparation! If he
was so fond of flame, as being more in the Herculeam style, why could not
he have chosen some secret woody mountain, where he might have gone
