XVhenwcr, Saturn, you ssiall make this reformation, then will a feast be
something like a feast, and ἦ life be life indeed; but if you do not, let
them keep the festival to themselves, whilst we sit down and pray most hear-
tily that when they come out of the bath, their servants may fall down and
break the jugg ·, that their cooks may spoil their broth with fat, or, think-
ing of something else, pour fifh-fauce upon their lentiles; that whilst their
sculiion‘s are absent, aclog may steal in, fall upon their forced-meat, and
(levour their checss-cakes! May their wild boars,·stags, and pigs, whilst
they are roasting‚ do, like 3- Homer’s oxen of the sun, or rather not only
creep as they did, but leap away into the mountains, spits and all, and their
fat heus, even after their feathers are plucked, fly away, that they may not
thus eat all their dainties alone ! May the ants, which will vex them most,
such as we read of in India, dig up their treasures‚ ‘and bring them forth to
public view ἔ May their fine cloaths, from the negligenee of their servans,
be eat through by our good friends the mice, and look like a fieve, or a
filhing net! May their pretty peges with long hair, their Hyacinthuses, and ¹
Narciffuffes‚ whilst they are holding the cup to them, become bald, and
their beards grow rough and {harp‚ like Satyrs in a comedy! May these, and a
thousand other evils fall upon the rich, if they will not leave off their ava-
rice and selfissmess‚ and give us a portion of their abundance!
