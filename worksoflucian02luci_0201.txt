was, with variety of dainties, in gold and filver dishes; the cups were of
gold3 the attendants handsome, well-dressed, sung well, and were facetious
and entertaininfffi every thing, in short, was delightsul‚ except being placed
close to Thes:;.opoli3, who teized me all the time with talking ahort vir-
