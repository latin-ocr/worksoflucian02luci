268 TnePARASITE.

T Y C H I A D E S.

In truth, my good friend, 1 have heard as much from others, and those
too, who did not say it merely for the sake oflaughing at, or abufing them,
nor do I therefore imagine you have belyed thern, in compliment to your
own art; but now, if you please, let us know how your friends behave in
battle, and whether any of the ancient heroes were parafiteS.

Every body, my friend, be he ever so ignorant, is acquainted with Ho-
vmer; and those that know him, know that his greatest heroes were parafites :
the famous Nestor, whose ’ἓ lips flowed with honey, was the king’s parasite ;
nor was Achilles, who not only seemed‚ but was the most beautiful and most
courageous of men, nor Diomed, nor Ajax‚ so much. praised and admired
by him as Nestor3 he does not wish for ten Ajax’s, or ten Achilles's‚ but
tells us he should ψ soon take Troy, if he had but ten such soldiers as this-
old parasite. Idomeneus too, the offspring of Jove, was another parasite, as.
he informs ωε, of Agamemnon'S.

T Y C H 1 A D E S.
1 remember very well what you mention, but 1 do not rightly comprehensi

why they must be styled parafites.

Restore our blood, and raise the warrior’s souls,
Tho' all the rest with stated rules we bound,
Unmixki, unmeasur'd‚ are thy goblets crown’d.
