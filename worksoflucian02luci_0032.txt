ON

DANCING,

ADIALOGUE.

One of the bad Consbquences arfing from the Company of Wss, who deal in Irony and,
Sarcafin is, that you never know whether they are in Jest or Earncst3 and this is
the Case with LuemN, in regard to the following Dialogue‚ which wearsfhch a
double Face, that it is dffcult to fhy whether he meant to ridicule the noble Science
of Dancing, or tricly and fhberly to defend and extol it. When he tells us, in the Be-
ginning, that Dancing is coeval with the Univerft, and that the World is nothing
but a grand Dance of Things‚ we can hardly conceive him to be serious ; and yet
in the latter Part of the Treatifi, the Gravity of his Arguments and Manner
would inclinem to think him fh. The whole, however, except, perhaps, the long
String of old Fubles, is entertaining and Jenfible.

LYCINUSANDCRATO.

L Y C 1 N U S.

S you have thought proper, my friend Crat0‚ for some time past to

bring most heavy complaints against dancing‚ to abuse the art itself,
and find fault with me for being fond of it, as spending all my time on a
frivolous and wornanish entertainment3 I must now convince you how great-
ly you are mistakcn‚ and how sadly you have forgot yourse1f‚ in speaking
thus contemptuoussy of one of the most agreeable things in life: it may,
however, be pardonable in you, who have been brought up and used to
a ,gloomy way of life, and have always imagined that nothing can be
good that is not harih and rig-id, and condemn that which you are an utter

strangu· to.
