Tm WISHES. 429

All these things would l have, not for a short space of time, like o·hc-1·
men, but for a thousand years, in a perpetual return of youth, {haking off
my old age every seventeen years, as the serpents do. With these rings I
could not poffibly be in want of any thing3 for all that belonged to others
would be mine, when I could open every gate, lay the keepers asseep, and,
wherever I came, be invifible. If, amongst the Indians, or Hyperboreans,
there was a remarkable spectacle3 any thing 1 would wish to poffcss, any
thing delicious to eat or drink, I would not take the trouble of having it
brought to me, but fly thither, and enjoy ir. If there was a flying dragm,
or a phoenix that nobody else could get a fight of, I would go and see it, a
would find out the head of the Nile, all the uninhabitable parts of the world,
and make a visit to the Antipode53 Ι would be acquainted with the nature
of the stars and the moon, nay, and of the sun himself, as his heat could not

in Syria, and sup in Italy: my enemy, Ι could revenge myself on secredy,
by throwing down a stone, and knocking him o' the head: on the other
hand, Ι could always make my friends happy, by showering gold upon them
in their sseep. If any rich fellow behaved contemptuoussy or tyrannically, I
would take him up a mile high in the air, and throw him down headlong‚
Then my love-intrigue5‚ nobody could prevent or interrupt‚ as Ι could get
in wherever I pleased, and lay every body to sseep, but those 1 wanted.
How pleasant must it beto overlook a battle, whilst one was out of the reach
of danger3 and, ifIthought proper, to come up to the conquerors, lay
them fast asseep, and give vi&0ry to the flying‚ and the vanquished ! Thus
would life be nothing but sport and entertainment to me, every thing would
be mine, and I should seem a perse& deity. Thus should I be blest with
happiness which treachery could not destroy, and length of days, uninter-
rupted by fickness or diseaxse.

And nOW, Lycium, what objection have you to my with?

LYCINUS.

O, none in the least; who would venture to find fault with a man⁴ that can
fiy, and is as strong as ten thousand common mortals? But, pray, tell me, in
all the nations you have flown over, have you ever met with a little mad old
fellow, who was carried about by a little ring, could move whole mountains
with the tip of his finger, and whom every body was in love with, though
