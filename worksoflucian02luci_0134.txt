home, wc bathed‚ and went to supper, talked‚ and drank plentifully: I

who kept her word with me, and made me so happy ‘³4‘ ’4 '⁴³ 4 4 ³⁶
that l almost foi-got my journey to Lariffa, and the bufincss which Ι came
about: desirous, however, before we parted of getting some intelligence
concerning this matter, “ My dear Palaestra, said 1 to her, cannot you some
day or other shew me your mistress praetifing her magic, and transforming
herself into something or other, for it is a sight which I much long for; or
rather, if you know any tricks of this kind yourself, lhew me some, and it
will be the same thing, as Imay judge of one by the other: Ι make no
doubt but you also are weil {killed in the art, as I know, indeed, by expe-

through a crevice in the door, and see what was going forward. There didI
behold a woman, who first undreffed herself, and then purting two grains of
incense into the flame of the lamp, repeated certain words, as if talking to
ir, after which ¹she opened a large drawer, that had several boxes in it, and
out of one of them took something, what it wasl could not tell, but it
looked like an ointrnent : with this, beginning from her toe-nails, she rub,
bed herself all over, when immediately wings spread themselves out on each
fide of her, her nose grew hard and crooked, she had every thing, in short,
all over her like a bird, and became a complete owl: as soon as she saw her·
self thus feathered, ssieset up a horrible screech, as these birds do,.and flew
out at the windoxv. For my part, l looked upon it as a dream, and rubbed
