JUPITERTHETRAGEDIAN. 167

hove you all to weigh and consider by what means it may be so managed that
Thnocles, in his next discourse‚ shall have the superiority, and Damis meet
with contempt and derifion3 for on Timocles himself I have not much dc-

pendence, nor do I think he will gain the viftory, unless we lend him some
