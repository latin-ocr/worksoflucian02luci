comprehend every thing which Homer, Hefiod, and the tragic poets have
recorded.

These few things, out of a great many, or rather a great many out of an
infinite number, I have here mentioned as indispenfibly necessary, leaving
the rest to be sung by the poets, or gleaned up by the artist himself, which
he must always have in readiness to produce, whenever he may have occa-
fion for them.

As his skill confists in imitation, and he undertakes to explain every thing

that is sung by gestures3 he must, like the orator, be always perspicuous
and intelligible‚ that whatever he points out may be plain and clear, an'd
not stand in need of an interpreter: for, as the Pythian oracle declared, the
dancer must be understood though he is dumb, and heard though hc says no·
thing. .
Something like this happened formerly to Demetrius the Cynic, who,
finding fault with dancing, as you do now, afferted that it succeeded merely
by the affistance of rnufic, conducing not at all of itself to the main aetion ι
but, that men were imposed on by a fine filken garment‚ a handsome masse,
the flute, and the good voices of the fingers with which that was set off,
though it had no merit of its own. An eminent dancer in the reign of Nero,
not less distinguished for his knowlege of history, than for the grace and‘
eloquence of his motions, only begged Demetrius, which was certainly a
very reasonable request, to see him dance before he condemned him, and:
promised to perform without mufic or finging; which he did, and command·
ing the instruments to cease, he danced before him the whole story of Mars
and Venus, the sun exposing them, Vulcan deteefing and throwing the
chains over the lovers, the gods standing by, Venus blulhing, Mars frighten-
ed and supplicating him; in such a 'manner as beyond measure to delight
Demetrius, who paid him the highest compliment, crying out with a lond>
voice, “ l not only see every thing you do, but even hear it als03 for your-
hands seem to speak to me.''

And now I am talking of Nero: I will tell you what happened in his
time, with regard to this very dancer whom Ι just now mentioned to you,
and which was the greatest encomium on the artitself. A certain barbarian
from Penius, of royal lineage, who came to Nero on some private bufiness,
saw this man <lance with several others ;Δ when he performed so amazingly,
that though he did not know the meaning of the finging that accompanied

him,
