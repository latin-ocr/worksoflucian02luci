Coming at length to a place where the road divided, we spied the robbers
who had seen us at a great distance by the light of the moon, and now rush-
ed upon 1153 they seized on the poor girl ; “ So, said they, fair virgin, why
would you leave us so suddenly, were you afraid of*ghosts·? but corne,-
you must go back with 113, we will restore you to your friends.'’ This they
said with aul« Sardonic smile, and then turned me back. l began immedi-
ately to secono& my wounded hoof, and went lame. “ Oho, said one of
them, now you arc taken, you are lame, but when you wanted to get away,
you were as nimblc as a horse, and as brisk as a bird.” Saying this, he laid
on me with a large stick, which made a fresh wound in my thigh. When
we came home, we found the old woman hanging from a part uf the rock,
asmid, probably, of her masters' anger, on account of the young woman’s
escape; she had put a rope round her neck, and dispatched herself. The
robbers admired her fidelity‚ and without farther ceremony, threw her,
rope and all, down the precipice. They then took the virgin, bound her
fast, and locked her up in the house, after which, they went to supper, and
caroused plentifully: they then entered into a consultation about their fair·
prisoner. “ W'hat {hall we do, says one of them, with this run—away ?'’
“ What ean we do better, says another, than send her after the old woman,
lhe has done us all the mischief 1116 could, and had like to have spoiled our
whole business. You must very well knOW, my friends, that if 1116 had once
got horne, not one of us would have been left alive; for the enemy would
have made head against u3, and we should have been all taken. Let us,
therefore, be revenged on her3 if we throw her down the precipice‚ she will
die too canly, let us think on some bitter‚ lingering death, that she may be
first tortured, and afterwards expire by degrees.'’ “ I have thought on a
method, says another, which I am sure you will approve ; we must destroy
that lazy ass, not only for shamrning lame, but for aiding and abetting her
in her slight3 to-morrow morning, therefore, we will kill hirn, take out his
bowels, and sow her up in the infide of him, with her head just out to pre-
vent suffore-arnon, and her body within his; we may then leave thern both,

† Sardonii- ] In the ill-„ind of Sardos, says the Greek scholiast, on this passage, grows an
herb resembling parssey, (probably hemlock‚) which, whoever tastes of, falls into a fit of im-
moderate laughter‚ and dies. Whence arose this proverbial expreffion ofa Sardonic laugh, to
fignify a malevolent exultation, portending missenum, misery, and death. See suidas and

Erasmus.
