TmPARASITE. 265

who was, himself, the parasite of ἂ Neleus, *Γ Euripides, belides, as you
very well knOW‚ was parasite to Archelaus, to the day ofhis death, as ’ἑᾷ Ana-
xarchus was to Alexander : as to Aristotle, he ᾧ touched but ssightly this
art, as he did on all the rest. philosophers, therefore, as ljust now observ—
ed, have frequently turned parafites, but nobody ever saw a parafite who
wished to turn philosopher. If never to know hunger, thirst, or cold, be
real happiness, parasites alone are happy: for, as to philosophers, many are
found starving, we never are: this is the fate of your wisc men only, or such
, wretches and beggars as resemble thern.

TYCHIADES.

True; but how will you prove, aster all, that your art is superior to rhe-

toric and philosophy?
S I M ⁷ Ο.

There are too seasons, my good friend, when the artS, and the professors
of them, have an opportunity of shewing their real inerit3 the time of war,
and the time of peace; let us, if you please, take the former, and consider

which will appear to the greatest advantage, and be of most service, both to
themselves and the public.

TYCHIADES.

An excellent trial of skill you have proposed, and I cannot help smiling to
myself, when Ι think of a parasite and a philosopher thus compared to·
gether.

⁸ Neleus] Concerning this Neleus we have very little information to be depended on,
though he is ssightly mentioned by Athenaeus. He waS, probably, however, some man of
fassiion and consequence at that time, with whom Aristoxenus was intimately connected.

ἢ Euripiden] This famous tragediam as it is well known, and recorded by all his biogra-
phers, left his native country, probably, on account of some ill treatment from his rivals, and
spent the latter part of his life at the court of Archelaus, king of Macedon, who loaded him
with favours, and treated him with all the respect due to his charaeter and abilities : this was a
sufficient foundation for Lucian to call him a parasite, a name which, notwithstanding, he
might probably very little deserve.

ἶ Anaxarchus] A philosopher os Abdera, and follower of Democritus. He lived intirely
with Alexander the Grem, and flourished about the hundred and tenth olympiad.

ξ Toaclml, &c.] Aristode, says Lucian, only {kimmed the surface of this art, ns he did
with regard to many others, by which he means, we may suppose, to insinuate that this grear
writertreated matters but superficinlly‚ and never went to the bottom of them. Of his abstruse
philosophy we have certainly enough, because if he had said more, he would only have been
more tedious: but when we turn to his rhetoric, tragedy, &c. we wilh, perhaps, with Luciam.
he had been more copious and explicit.
