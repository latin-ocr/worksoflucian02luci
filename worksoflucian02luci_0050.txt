44 OnDANCING.

pus, to every one of them.’' This is absolutely necessary to the dancer, who
must adhere to, and be familiar with every thing about him. The art pro-
seffes to describe the manners and paffions, and to express thern by-aetion,
to represent men as affeeted by love, by anger, by grief, by madness, and·
every one ofthem with its peculiar gestures. What is most astonishing, is,
that in the same day is often performed the charae‘ter of a raging Athamas,
an affrighted Ino, an Atreus, or Oerope, and all by one and the same person.

Other speetaeles and representations either for the eye or ear, exhibit but
one thing, itis the pipe, the harp, the song, the cornedy, or the tragedy‚
but dancing comprehends them all ; you have the pipe, the harp, the cyma
bal, the motion of the feet, the chorus finging, and the aeter speaking,
every thing, in short, put together into one: in other things, the funetions
of the mind and body are separately exerted, but in this they are united : it
exercises the limbs, and at the same time employs the understanding3¹ foa·
nothing is done in it without wisdom and reason. Lesbonax, therefore, of
Mytilene, one of the best and worthiest of men, used to say, that dancers had
wife heads ; he went frequently, therefore, to see them, as thinking he never
came ont of a theatre without being the better for it : and his master, Timo-
crates, having been only once, and that when he was far advanced in years,
present atthis entertainment, cried out after it was over, VVhataspetStacle
hath the fooliffi shame of a philosopher so long deprived me of!

If Plato's division of the soul into three parts, the irascible, the concu-
piscible, and the rational, be aj-ust one, the good dancer may be said to
perform them all when he represents the angry man, the lover, and lastly,
the moderate and senfible man, who guides every thing by reason: reason„
indeed, presides over, and direets the whole of this art, being diffused
through every part, as the touch is in every sense. Wh‘ilst‚ moreover, it
consults beauty and grace, doth it not demonstrate the truth of Aristotle's
alsertion, who says in praise of beauty‚ that it makes one third of the happi-
ness of this life? And 1 have heard young men, jesting on the silence of the
dancers, observe, that it savoured much of the Pythagoream do&rine.

Some studies boast ofthe use-ful, and others the agreeable3 but this alone
poffefftt'n both : and the profit is still greater, because it is joined with plea—
sure. It may be agreeable to see the contentions of young men, wrestling
in the saud, beating one another with their fists, and drenched in blood3 but
how mne-h [nore pleasant, safe, and decent, is the representation of it in a

dance ἔ
