588 TRAGOPODAGRA,&c.

CHORUS.

''- In vain, of 01d, the rash Salmoneus strove
To 'unitate the thunder from above ; }

'l‘ransiiffd he lies beneath the bolts of Jove.
ἦν Marsyas no more with great Apollo vies,
But yanquissx'd yields the long-contested prize ;
Beneath an'humbler form, by pride betray'd,
Stin spins, unpity'd, the ζ Moeonian maid;
Whilst Niobe, sad mother, 1d091n'dt0 moun
Her hapless lot, and num'rousoffspring gone,
Laments her crime in ever-weeping'stone.

Such is the wretched fate that mnst'at'tend
On impious mortals, who with gods contend-
Gout! O hear thy suppliants pray'r,

Us, thy constant vot’ries, spare;
¹· Short and easy be our pain,
Let us feel our feet again !
§Hasd is the lot of mortals here be10w3
But we some interval? of comfort know, }
For use and patienee' leffen ev’ry woe.
Cease, then, my fellow-suff'rers, to complain,
For the kind goddess may relieve our pain :
Mean time, be che'arfu1‚ blith, and gay,'
And let us laugh our pains away ;
This, this, my friends, is suited to our state,
And this alone can sooth the rigour of our fate.

ὓ In vaith] This last song of the Chorus is not more remarkable for true humour, than
for its fingular propriety. To raise the charaeter of his heroine, the goddess Geor, Lucian
here makes her attendants enumerate the most celebrated instances of human rassmess, severely
pun'nhed for contend'mg with divine power. Very few of the tragic Choruffes in AEschylus‚ So·
phocleS, or Euflpides, are so well adapted to the subjeet.

† Mmfflas] Who was flea'd alive for attempting to play upon the flute with Apollo.
ζ Moeoniqn Masta] Arachne, turned into a spider‚ for'contending with Minerva. See Ovid's
Metamorphoses, b. vi.

ξ Har-d is the fare, ἐξα] The original is a parody on some lines in the Andromache of Eu-
ripides.
