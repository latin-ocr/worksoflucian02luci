TYGHIADES.

No n0, let us have it now, unless you are afhamed.
S Ι M O.
It is the art of parafitism.
T Y C H Ι Α D E S.
And would {ny one but a madrnan call this an art?

S Ι M O.
Yes, Ι do; and ifI am mad, confidet that this madness excuses me fron}

learning any other art, and then Ι arn sure you will aequit me; for that same
daemon, madness, however dreadful it may be to those who labour under it,
is never blamed for the faults it commits, any more than the scholar is for
what his master has taught him.
T Y C H Ι A D E S.
The parasite, therefore, pra&ises an art?
S I M O.
Certainly; and that art 1 arn master of.
T Y C H Ι A D E S.
You own yourself a parafite then?

TYCHIADES.

Don't you bluss1 when you call yourself n parasite?

S I M O.
By no means: on the contrary, 1 should have more reason to blush ifI

didnot.
TYCHIADES.

And ifI wanted to describe you to a person who defu-ed to know what you
were, would you have me say, a parafite?
Ι S 1 Μ 0.
Were you to calla statuary Phidias, you would not please hirn more than
you do me, by calling me a parafite3 nor do 1 glory less in my art, than he

did in his Jupiter.
