ONCALUMNY'.

355

On the right hand fide fits a man with ears almost as large as Midas’s,
stretching forth his hand towards the figure of Calumny, who appears at a
distance coming up to him ; he is attended by two women, who, l imagine,
represent Ignorance and Suspicion. From the other fide approaches Calnmny,
in the form of a woman, to the last degree beautiful, but scerning warm and
inflamed, as full of anger and resentment; bearing a lighted torch in her
left hand, and with her right dragging by the hair of his head a young
man, who lifts up his eyes to heaven, as calling the gods to witness his in-
nocence. Before her stands a pale ugly figure, with sharp eyes, and ema-
ciated‚ like a man worn down by disease‚ which we easily perceive is meant
for Envy ; and behind are two women, who seem to be employed in dreffing,
adorning, and affisting her; one of whom, as my interpreter informed me,
was Treachery, and the other Deceit: at some distance, in the back part of
the picture, stood a woman, in a mourning habit, all torn and ragged,
which, we were told, represented Penitence3 as she turned her eyes back,
sne blushed and wept at the sight ofTruth, who was approaching towards her,

In this manner did Apelles express the danger he had escaped from. And
now, if you please‚ we will endeavour to imitate the Ephefian painter, and
describe Calumny‚ with every thing that belongs to her: Calumny then, is an
accusation made without knowlege of the person accused, brought against
one party who is absent, and believed by the other, having no one to con-
tradi& it.

Such is the subject-matter of this discourse. But here, as in our comedies,
there are three principal parts; he who brings the accusation, he against
whom it is made, and he to whom it is brought; let us confider them all
by turns, and enquire into the bufiness of each: to begin then, with him
who plays the first part, the author of the calumny; that such a one can
never be a good man, is indisputable, for no good man ever injures ano-
ther; he rather strives to prevent the effeets of envy and jealousy, by recon-
ciling men one to another, and shews his benevolence by his good opinion
of his friends and neighbours: it were easy to shew‚ that the calumniator
must be the most unjust, wicked, and pernicious of men; nobody will deny
that impartiality is the effence ofjustice, and partiality of injustice3 does
not he, then, who ssanders the absent, take more upon himself than he ought,
doth he not entirely seize upon, and possess the heaoer, whose ears already
filled with calumny, are entirely shut against the other fide? The greatest,

this,
