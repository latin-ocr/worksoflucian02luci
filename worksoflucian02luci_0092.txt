that they shall grow young again. Flattery would be valuable, indeed, if
it could produce such effeets; but it will prove the dire& contrary: for the
same thing must happen to such, as would to an ugly man putting on a
handsorne mask, and boasting of his beauty‚ though it might so easily be
taken offby any body, and he of course only become the more ridiculous,
when his own face appeared from under the vizard‚ and dete&ed him: as
ifa little follow should put on a cothurnus, and then pretend to measure
with a man taller by three foot than himself standing on the plain ground.
She then told mc a story ofa woman of the first rank, and who was, withal‚
handsome and agi-eeable‚ but short, and much below the common stature,
who was extolled by a poet in his verses for her height, as well as her
other accomplishments, and compared, for her fize and straiznc-ss, to a pop-

illness ε she sate, nevertheless, to hear a set of execrable poets praifing her
Hyacinthin locks, making them up into curls, and comparing them to
leaves of parssey, though, 'in fact, there was not one belonging to her.

panthea, therefore, laughed at all those who yielded themselves up to
adulation, and observed, that praises were like pistures, which pleased only
because they flattered and deceived; many, said she, only admit those
painters who can draw a handsome likeness of the1n; there are even some
who will bid the artist take off part of a nofe, make the eyes blacker, or
add any other beauty, which they would be thought poffeffed of: forgetful
that they are all the while crowning with applause such piClures as do notin
the least resemble themselves.

Such were her observatione on your book, which, however, in many parta
she much admhed, though she could not bear your comparing her to Juno
