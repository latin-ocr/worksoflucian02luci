ENC'OMIUM 0N DEMOSTHENES. 523

A R C [H Ι Α S.
But, was not Demosthenes one of our most inveterate enemies ?

A N T Ι Ρ Α Τ Ε R.

No: if saith and truth have any charnis, if what is firm and incorruptible
deserves esteem and approbation : honesty is honesty, even in an enemy, and
virtue precious, wheresover it is found : nor would I wilh to behave worse
than Xerxes, who, when it was in his power to destroy Bulis and Sperchis,
because he deservedly admired, set them free. Demosthenes, whom I met
twice at Athens, though [had not leisure to converse with him, whofi:
actions and charaeter I was well acquainted with, was a man whom I had
always the highest veneration for, and that, not, as may be supposed, for
his eloquence alone·, though Python and the orators of Athens were nothing
when compared to him, whether we confides the elegance of his style, the
harmohy of his periods, the force of his arguments, or that wonderful power
of convietion which he was poffeffed of. Very sorry 1 was that I convened
the Greeks, induced by Python and his promises, in order to refute the Athe-
nians, when the thunder of Demosthenes was exerted against me: his elo-
quence shut up every avenue against us: bnt Ι confidet· this noble quality
merely as an instrument, made use of by him, to carry on his politi'cal de-
figns. What 1 most admired him for, was his good sense and discretion;
that fortitude which he shewed in adverfity, and which enabled him, even
when almost overwhelmed beneath the waves of ill-fortune, to rise superior
to it, and seem insenfible of danger. Ι am satisfied, that Philip also enter-
tained the same opinion of him : for once, 1 remember, when he was told
that Demosthenes had inveighed against him in the senate, and Parmenio,
in an angry mood, was throwing out some bitter sarcasm on this great ora-
tor: “ Demosthenes (said Philip) has a right to speak with freedom; for
he is the only Grecian orator whom Ι have not in my pay, though Ι had
much rather trust to him, if I could have {cenred him, than to my navies
and armies. Amongst most of his brethren, both here and in Boeotia,
Ihave scattered my gold, herds, cattle, and annual presents: but I could
sooner take κ’ Byzantium by stOrH], than bribe Demosthenes.'' “ If an
Athenian, haranguing at Athens, (replied Parmenio,) was to prefer me

ἃ Byzantium] This city was confidered as the key οῖ’ Greece. Philip was prevented from
taking it by the eloquence of Demosthenes.
