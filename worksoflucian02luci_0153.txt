JUPITERCONFUTED. 147

C Y N I S C U S.
Observe me, them you have read the pocms of Homer and κ’ Hefiod:

inform me, therefore, whether that be true which they have sung concerning
the Fates‚ that, whatever they determined at our birth, is absolutely nn—

avoidable?
J U P 1 T E R.

O most indisputably: there is nothing which the Fates do not pre-ordeum
whatever is wound upon their reel, must continue from the † beginning ol'
life to the end of it, and cannot posfibly be altered.

C Y N 1 S C U S.
When Homer, therefore, in another part of his poem, sayS,

 

Beware, nor antedate thy doom,
Defrauding fate of all thy fame to come;

we must suppose him to be a little out of his senses.

U P Ι Τ Ε R.
No doubt of it: nothingJ must transgress the law of the Parcae, or break

their thread. Whatever poets fing by inspiration of the Muses, is true; but
when they are desei-ted by the Godcleffes, and make verses of their own heads,
then they mistake and contradi& themselves: as rnen, however, they are
intitled to pardon, though ignorant of truth‚ when that power is no longer
with them, which, when present, dietated to, and inspired them.

C Y N 1 S C U S.
Ι am satisfied it must be so: but, may Ι aik another question? the faites,

1 think, are three in number, ξ Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos. J U P
θ Hestod.] From the same parent sprung the rig'rous three,

The goddesses of fate and destiny,

Clotho and Lachesis, in whose boundless sway‚

With Atropos, both men and gods obey ;

To human tace, they from their birth ordain‚

A life of pleasure, or a life of paim

'1'0 ssav’ry, or to empire, such their pow'r,

They fii< a mortal at his natal hour;

The crimes of men and gods the Fates pursue‚

And give to each alike the vengeance due. See Hefiod’s Theogony·

† The beginning.] -— Let him fall, as faoes defigu,
That spun so lhort his life'e illustrious line.
See Pope’s Homer's Iliad, book xx. l. 154.
’ζ Beware, &c.] Neptune’s speech to AEneas. See Pope’s Hoiner's Iliad, book xx- l. 385.

ξ Clotho, Effe] These three ladien, it seems, divided the business between them, Clotho

prefided over, and diretted the natal honr, Lachesis ⁵wourrd up the thread of events in life, and
