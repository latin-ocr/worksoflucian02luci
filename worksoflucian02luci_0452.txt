THE

FUGITIVES,

ADIALOGUE.

The very extraordinary Cirsumstances which attendea' the Death os Pssanonnws,
as related in the preceding Letter, naturally led our facetious Author into sbme Re-
flefliom on the Introduftion and Succeſs of that false Philosbphy which prevailed
amongst the Sophgsts of his Time, and which at length became a fair Objec‘l of his
Satire. The following Dialogue on this Sabjeaez is lively and entertaining‚ and
one may venture to pronounce it Lucmu‘s, with all due Defhrence to those learned
Critics who are of another Opinion with regard to it.

APOLLO, JUPITER, &c.

APOLLO.

RAY, father Jupiter, is it true that ³⁶ a man hasthrown himself into
the fire at the Olympio games, an old fellow it seems, who has long
been adealer in tricks and prodigies? The Moon told it me; the saw him

buming. J U P 1 T E R.

Apollo, it is true enough : and 1 wilh it had never happened.

APOLLo.

Why so; was he so good a man, and one that did not deserve to be

burned?
J U P 1 T E R.

Ι do not know that3 but this I knOW‚ that Ι have suffered horribly from a
dreadful stench, which always rises from a roasted carcase: ifl had not gone
immediately to Arabia, the stench would have killed me, and as it is, with
all these sweet smells, and plenty of spice and frankincense, I can scarce get
the scent out of my nostrils: even now Ι arn ready to puke when Ι think
of it.

⁴¹· A mam] Peregrinus. The ceremmxy, we may remember, was performed at night, and

b? ’the light of the moon ; Apollo, therefore, or the Sun, may be supposed to know nothing
o ιι.
