580 TRAGoPODAGRmoa,

To the rough horrors of an θ(- unmade bed ε

Fain would I reach the door} ,but my ssow limbs
Refuse their aid ε do thou, my aRive foui,

Urge on the lazy load 3 for he who would,

But cannot move, miist fink into the grave.

, But who are these with † elder chaplets crown’d,
Who on their eruthes lean ? They are not thino,

O Paean Phoebus ! for no laurel boughs

Their templi-s xvi-cath3 nor do they chaunt to Bacchus
The festive lay, for on their brows no leaves

Of ivy twine3 say, gentle guests, what god
Claims the fair tribute of your welcome song?

CHORUS.

Say, what art thou Ρ for by that hobbling gait,

And ’ζ strong supporter‚ we {hou'd call thee priest
Of that unconquer’d deity, whom we
Ourselves adore.

GOUTY MAN.

Can such a wretch as 1 am
Be worthy of your goddess’s attention?

CHORUS‚

She left her native heav'n3
‘Whilst Tethys nourish’d, with unceafing love,
The white-arm’d confort of Olympio Jove,
