ENCOMIUM oN DEMOSTHENILS. 521

he, at length, found the book, which Ι took and carried away with me;
and no sooner had I gone through, than I resolved to read it to you.
word for word, without altering a syllable of it: nor is iOEsculapius leis
honoured at his festival, by the repetition of verses froin ³¹⁶ Alisodeintm
or Sophocles, than if they were to make new ones on thc occasion. At:
the feast of Bacchus, they have =left off repeating new poenis, comedics,
and tragedies; but content themselves with the old ones, as paying the
same honour to the gods.

The book tells us (in that part of it which concerns the matter in hand,
and which is written in dialogue,) that Antipater had just received notice of
Archias's arrival. This Archias (which some of the young men herc may,
perhaps, not be acquainted with) was the person commiffioned to seize on
those who had been proscribed, and who had received orders from the king
to bring Demosthenes to him, rather by fair means, if poffib‘e, than by
force of arins, out of Calauria. Antipater was now in daily expectation of
seeing hirn; and, as soon as he heard that Archias was returned, ordered
him into his presence ι as soon as he came in—but the book will tell you the

rest; it runs thus: >
†A R c H 1 A s.

Health and happiness to Antipater.

A N T Ι P A T E .
Health and happiness will attend me, if you hage brought Demosthenes.

A R C H 1 A S.
That‚ as far as was in my power, 1 have done3 for I have got all that

remains of him in this urn.
A N T 1 P A T E R.
Archias, you have ruined all my hopes : what will his ashes π, :Ji-1³, tf 1

have not Demosthenes ?
A R C H I A S.

His soul, O king, could not be retained by violence.

Α A N T 1 P A T E R.
Why did not you take him alive ?

⁰ Alg'fhdemus] This poet is not mentioned, [believe, by any other writer, though, by n».
being put into company with Sophocles, we should conclude him to have been a man of sone

distinction.
ἦ· This dialogue is curious and entertaining, and gives us the highest idea both of Antipater
and Demosthenes„
