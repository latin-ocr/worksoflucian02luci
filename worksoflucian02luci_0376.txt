know of the attack upon him: when he is once within the walls, he burns,
destroys, and lays waste every thing, as must naturally happen when the
mind is totally subdued and reduced to ssavery.

The instruments which he generally makes use of against the absentare
fraud, lying, perjury‚ impudence‚ importunity‚ and a thousand others;
but the most necessary of all is flattery, the relation, or rather fister of Ca-
