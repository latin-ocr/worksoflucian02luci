JUPITER THETRAGEDIAN. 159

J U N o.
1 tell you', I know it well enough, it is some love affair3 but you have so
often injured me in that point that Ι {hall not cry about it. 1 suppose you
have found some new Danae, Semele, or Europa, that you are fond of,
and are confidering whether you shall be a bull, a satyr, or a shower of gold,
flowing through the tiles, into the bosom of your mistress: fighs, groans,
tems, and that pallid hue can be symptotns of nothing but love.
J U P 1 T E R.
Ridiculous ! to think lam uneasy about such rrifles.
J U N o.
What is there else that can make Jupiter unhappy ?
J U P 1 T E R.
Juno, the affairs of the gods are in imminent danger; we stand, as the
proverb says, on the edge of a razor, and it is a moot point whether, hence-
forth‚ we are to be worihipped, and receive any honours from mortals, or

be totally negleSred‚ and despised.
J U N o.
Has the earth then brought forth more giants, have the Titans burst their

chains, subdued their keepers, and taken up arms against us?
J U P 1 T E R.

'f Be not alarm’d, for all is safe below.
J U N ο.
What then can happen befides, so very terrible? if this is not the cause
of your grief, what is it that can make you thus put on ἦ* Polus and Aristo—

demus, instead of Jupiter?
J tJ P 1 T F. R.

I will tel] you; there was yesterday a dispuoe, I do not know how it δε.»
gan, between Timocles, the Stoic, and Darnis, the Epicurean, concerning
providence‚ before a large and respeffihrble audience. Damis afferted (which
hurt me most), that there were no gods, to look over and dire& human
affairs ; whilst the good Timocles, on the other hand, undertook to defend
our cause. A number of people crouding in upon them, they did not finish
the discourse, but parted with a resolution to meet again, and determine the
point some other time: and now it remains in doubt who will gain the
viCtory. You see what danger we are in, and that all depends on one man:
