SATURNALIAN EPISTLES. 471

the ground, though, as you well know, we could a& our parts as well,
and strut as grandly as they can do, if any body would furnish us with the
buskin.

The poets have long since told us that it was not so when ‘'f-² you held the
reins of empire, when the earth yielded her fruits without ploughing or
sowing, and every man eat and drank as much as he pleased3 the rivers
flowed with milk and wine, and some with honey. Men themselves were
all gold, and no such thing as poverty ever carne near them: our's on the
contrary is scarce worthy to be called a leaden age, it is even of a bafer
metal; a living is hardly to be gained by toil and labour, and there is no-
thing but penury, murmuring, and despair amongst us. But all this you
well know we could bear with patience, did we not at the same time behold
the rich in such affluence and prosperity, loeking up their gold and filver,
wearing rich garments, buying ssaves and chariots, with whole fields and
villages; and so far from parting with any thing to the poor and needy, that

chests; command them to invite, now and then, four or five of us to sup-
per, not after the present mode, but in a liberal and noble manner, that we
may all be pattakers of their bounty : let not one man surfeit himself with
dainties, his ssave standing by him till he can eat no longer, nor when the
servant comes to us, and we stretc'h out our hand, let him pass by and only shew
us the relies, without suffering us to taste them, give their master the whole
hog, and then throw us the bones. Let us not be forced to ask the cup--
bearer halfa dozen times for a draught‚ but when the master orders him, let
him pour it out immediately, and give us a bumper: above all, let every
