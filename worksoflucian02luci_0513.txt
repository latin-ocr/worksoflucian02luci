On THE SYRIANGODDESS. 507

wisc another thing in this statue rnost wonderful, which is, that, which ever
way you stand, it always looks towards you.

Between these, there stands another statue of gold, to which they have
given no name, but call it simply the statue3 not insorming us whence it
came, or whom it represents: some say, it is Bacchus, some Deucalion, and
others Semiramis, on account of the golden pigeon on its head; this is
sent every year, as I before observed, to bring up the water from the sea.

As you enter the inner temple, on the left hand, is a throne for the sun,
but no statue of him: they have, indeed, no images or representations,
either of the sun or moon, and the reason which they give is, that the forms
of other deities are not generally known, whereas the sun and moon are seen

by all ; where is the neceffity therefore of representing what is so universally
conspicuous, and appear constantly in the heavens?

Near this throne is a statue of Apollo, but with a beard, and not as he is
generally represented, a youth just rifing into manhood3 they find fault with
the Grecians for making him a b0y3 it is a mark of folly, they say, to attri-
bute any imperfeffiffion, and as such they consider youth, to the gods : their
Apollois likewise distinguished from others, by being cloathed3 concerning
his works here Ihave much to relate, but shall confine myself to those faecs

⁷ that are rnost extraordinary3 to begin therefore with the oracles, of which

there are many in AEgypt, Greeoe, Afia, and Libya·, but in other places
the answers are given by priests and prophets, whilst, in this, the god him«
self alone delivers them. When he is inclined to send forth any oracles, the
seat is observed to move: he is then lifted up by the priests; if they do not
perform this office, the statue sweats‚ and moves itself into the middle of
the temple3 but, when they lift up the deity, he drives them all before him in
a ring: then the high-priests asks him questions of every kind: if he does
not think proper to answer them, he goes back, if he does, he drives the
priests before him, as acoachrnan does his horses, with a rein. Thus it
is that they receive the oracle‚ and nothing either of a public or privare
nature is transaered, without first consulting him; he foretells what will
happen in the year, and how the seasons will turn out, and likewise set-
tles the time when the statue, which I mentioned above, is to take its pro-

ress.
