DEATH oF PEREGRINUS.

Ueis Letter contains a carious Aceount of a very extraordinaty Charafter, who
figured in the Time of Lucuw, it is supported by the concurrent Testimofy of
fiveral contemporary Authors, both Chrfiian and Heathen. The Singulari& of
thisylmpcstor’s Exit, with the Circumstances attending it mnsi naturall ‚ indeed,
have attracted universc'zl Notice, and may serve withal to convince us that there is
nothing, however abficrd, or unaccountable, which Ambition cannot dietate, and
the Love of Fame render Men capable of perfhrming.

Lucian to Cronius wishes health.

HE unfortunate Peregrinus, or Proteus (for so he always chose to

style himself), has at length met with the fate of his name-sake in
³* Homer3 for, after taking a thousand shapes, he is at last turned into fire:
such was his insatiable thirst after glory. Yes‚ my friend, this first and
greatest of men is reduced to a cinder, following the example of ψ Empe-
docles3 with this difference only, that he seemed rather willing to conceal
himself from the eyes of men, when he threw himself into the flames, whilst
our noble hero chose the most public festival, built a magnificent funeral-
pile, and leaped in, before innumerable witneffes‚ after haranguing the Gre-
cians, and acquainting them with his intention some days before the cere-

mony.

⁰ Homon] Alluding to his description os Proteus,

Instant he wears, elufive of the rape,
The mimic force of ev’ry savage ssmpe,
Or glides with liquid lapse a murm’ring stream,

Or wrapt in flame, he glows at ev’ry limb.
See Pope’s Homer's Odyss‘ey, book iv. 1. 563.

† Empedocles] The famous philosopher of Agrigentum, in Sicily, a Pythagoream Ainongst
other incrediblestories of him we are told, that after performing many miraculous cures, hc
retired to mount AEtna, and leaped into the fire, in hopes of leaving behind him an opinion
that he was a god; the populace, from his sudden disappearance‚ not knowing what was be-
come of him 2 the trick, however, which was a foolish one enough for a philosopher, was dis-
covered by one of his brass sandals being cast up from one of the volcanos.
