ENcoM1UM ort DEMOSTHENES. 525

311 their fleets and armies. What Themistocles and Pericles were to the an-
cient Athenians, is Demosthenes to the present: the unclerstanding and know*
lege of the one, the wisdom, eloquence, and courage of the other, are com-
bined in him. Iam obliged to them for sending out Chares, Diopithcs,
Proxenus, and such like generals, and keeping Demosthenes at home: ir
they were to appoint him leader of their army and navy, and superintend-
ant over all their affairs, I should tremble for Macedonia itself; as it is he
haraffes me with his counsels, finds perpetual resources, furnishes new flects
and armies, is present in every place, and 11611161111111)Γ opposes me.’'

Thus would Philip often talk to me concerning him, ever looking upon
it as >the greatest instance of his good fortune, that their armies were not
led by Demosthenes, whose animated speeches, like so many battering-rams,
beat down all his counsels. After the vietory at Cheronaea, many 3 time
would 116 6311 to mind the perils we had been in on his account; ‘⁶ for,
though, (said he,) through the imprudence of their generals, the confusion
of their troops, and our own i1nexpe6ted good fortune, we conquered 3 yet,
011 that very day, did I run the hazard both of my crown and life, by his
means, so firmly did he unite the cities, colle& the forces, Thebans, Athe-
nians3 Corinthians, and Eubaeans, into 0116 body, and prevent my pene·
trating into the interior parts of Attica.'’

Thus would he be perpetually talking of Demosthenes, and if any body
observed to him that the Athenians were his most powerful enemies, his
constant answer was, “ Demosthenes is my only enemy3 the Athenians with-
out him would be no more than AEnians, or Theffalians.'' Whenever he
sent ambafl'adors to the cities, and the Athenians employed any other ora-
tors to 1116361 for thern, he was sure to be successful; but whenever Demos-
thenes came; ‘⁴ Our embaffy, he would say, is vain; for vietory over his
orations no trophies can ever be raised :’' and what would you have me, who
am so much inferior to Philip, do with this man? Should 1 lead him as an
ox to the ssaughter, or 1110111611 not rather make him my counsellor and
friend? Such Ι would wish to find him, not only from the opinion which Ι
have of him from his own 38610115, but from the testimony also of Aristode,
who affured me that Alexander admired him above all men, for his 610-
quence, freed0m‚ fortitude, and wisdom. Would you put such 3 man up-
on a level with * Eubulus, Phrynon, and Philocrates? Do you think it
