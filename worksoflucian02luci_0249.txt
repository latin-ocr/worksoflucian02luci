He perceived, rnoreover, that those who talked so much about patience and
long-suffering, were, in private, fond of pleasure3 and however they might
boast abroad of temperance‘ and fortitude, would indulge themselves in lux-
ury at home; that when they were found a little remiss, in not adhering 10
their tenets, they would blusti at the discovery, though they could but ill
support this tantalifing punishment·, and whenever they had an opportunity
of violating the laws in secret, and without sear of punishment, took down
full draughts of sensuality. If, therefore, they could procui-e the ring or*
’Χ- Gyges, or the helmet of ⁹3— OrCUS, to make them invifible, Ι make no
doubt but they would all bid adieu to labour, and, one after another, fol-
low pleasure‚ as Dionysius did before them, who, for a long time flattered
himself, that t'heir leftures and disputations would be of service to him; till
fickness and pain came upon him, and then finding byexperie'nce, thast the for-
tico and his weak frame did not agree well together, ga‘ve credit to one rather
than the other3 began to feel that he was a mortal, and had a mortal's bod) ;
he resolved, therefore, not to treat it like a statue, being well convinced‚
that whoever pretended to be of a different opinion, and to find fault with
pleasure‚ only boast in word, whilst in deed their minds are fixed upon it.

Ἃ· Gygen] A king of Lydia, who dethronedv Candaules, and succeededv to his kingdom, had
a ring, by turning a certain part of which upwards, he could render himself invisible. li the
reader would wissi to know how he came by the ring, and what use he made of it, 1 refer him
to the third book of Tully’s Offices, where he will find the whole romuntic story told from
Plato by the Roman orator, with his philosophica] refleetions upon it.

1·- Orcus-J Alluding to that pass‘age in the fifth book of the iliad, where Minerva,

 

to hide her heav’nly visage, spread
Black Orcus’ helmet o’er her radiant head. See Pope’s Hom. 11. b. v. l. 1036.
As every thing that goes into the dark empire of Pluto, or Orcus, disappears, and is scen no

more t the Greeks from thence borrowed this figurative expreffion 3 to put on Orcus, or Pluto's
helmet, that is to say, to become invisible.
