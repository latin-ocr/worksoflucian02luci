ENCOMlUM οη DEMOSTHENES. 515

mer dId that of the GreekS, merely by calling thern women instead of men,
and is generally more warrn and spirited 111 his descriptions than the other, ¹
who in the heat of battle makes his heroes talk too much, and ‹lamps the ar-
dour of the engagement with tales and fableS. Iam pleascd in Demosthenes
with the divifion of his parts, the haimony of his periods, and that poetic al.
sweetness which adorns his works: whilst, on the otl ier hand, Homeris by
no means deficient 1n antithesis, comparismw, spirited figures, and purity os
language: the graces, both of art and nature seem united m him. Ι by no
means, therefore, as you plainly see, hold your muse in contempt, though Ι
think an encomium on Homer more diffieult than one on Demosthenes3 for,
exclusive of his poetry, lhave nothing sure and certain to go upon: all is
hidden from us, nor do we know the least of his country, his family, or the
time when he flourished. If we had any thing to depend on, with regaird to the
place of his nativity, we should no longer be 111 doubt whether it was Colo·
phou, or Cumae, or Chios, or Smyrna, or ssffigyptian Thebes, or fifty other
places; or whether he was sprung from Maeon, the Lydian river, and Me-
lanope, or some nymph or dryad; whether he livessl 1n the age of ancient
heroes, or in later times: we know not whether he was prior = r posterior to
Hefiod, whether he rs the οῙ5”-·(1’ Melesigenes, or whether he was reall), as
reported, poor and blind. We must content ourselveS, therefore, tolet all
these things remain in their original obscurity, and confine our eulogium ro
his verses, and the excellent leffons of wisdom and virtue contained in them.
But your bufiness is alil ready to your hand ; the exquisite dish is prepared,
and you haye nothing to do but to garnissi it. Fortune bestowed on Demos-
thenes every thing that was great, illustrioris, and defireable. Athens was
his country, that noble city, the pillar ofGreece, celebrated by so many ex—
cellent poets: on this head I could bring in the adventures of the gods, their
gists, their habitations, their divifions, with the Eleusiniam mysteries: I
could introduce the Athenian laws‚ their affemblks, their conquests and tri·
umphs by land and sea, subjeets that require the nerve and elegance of a
Demosthenes himself to describe; this would afford ample matter for a pa-
negyfflc, nor should I be singular in drawing part of my encomium from his
country. Isocrates, in his praise os Helen, brought in Theseus: poets,
you know, have a licence for every thing3 but, you will say, 1 transgress the

θ* Male gener] Homer is supposed to have taken this name from the river Meles, running
by the walls os Smyrna in Ionia, with a cave at its head, where he is said to have written his

poems.
