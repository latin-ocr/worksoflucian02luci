OuCALUMNY. 369

With Alexander the Great‚ the most heinous of all crimes wau, not to
adore and worship Hephaestion z, so fond was he of his friend after death,
that to otherinstances of magnificence he would add that of making with his
own handa deity of a ἥ deceased mortal. Several cities did accordingly,
therefore, erec't temples and altars, consecrate groves, offer sacrifices, and
appoint festivals in honour of the new god: the most solemn oath which a
rnan could swear by, was the name of Hephaestion; if any one had so little
religion in him as to sneer at all this, his punishment was death,· the flatterers,
laying hold of this childilh whim of Alexander's, blew up and increased
the flame, told of dreams that were sent by him, talked of his appearing ro
them, and healing their distempers, produced oracles delivered by him,
and at length sacrificed to him as to the ever—present god, the deliverer
from every evil. Alexander was so delighted with this as ro believe every
thing that was said,and to congratulare himself that he was not only the son os
a god, but that he could make gods of others. How many friends of Alex-
ander must we suppose there were at that time who suffered for the divinity of
Hephaestion, when they were calumniated for not worshipping this universal
deity, and for that reason only were deprived of the royal favour !

Agathocles, the Samian, a general of Alexander's, and in high esteem
with him, was notwithstanding very near being shut up with a lion, having
been accused of † lhedding tears as he paffed the tomb of Hephaestion ; but
Perdiccas, we are told, came seasonably to his relief, and swore by all the
gods, not forgetting Hephaestion himself, that the new deity appeared to
him one day as he was hunting, and commanded him to tell Alexander that
he must pardon Agathocles, who had wept, not because he wanted saith, οι·
considered him as a dead mortal, but merely from the remembrance of their
past friendssrip. Thus calumny and adulation, we see, worked more power-
fully on Alexander when they fell in with his ruling paffions; for asin a
siege the enemy never* attack the strong, guarded, and inacceffible places,
but if they find any part that is weak, low, and ill-defended, by which they
may eafily get' into and take the city, exert all their force against that, and
that only3 in like manner does the calumniator, when he discovers the weak

his divinity.
