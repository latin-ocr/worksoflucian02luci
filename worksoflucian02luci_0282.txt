ANACHARSIS.

A DIALOGUE on GYMNASTIC EXERCISES.

<she Advantages aristng from the public gymnastic Exerczsts praHised in· Greece, and
the Inconveniencessbmetimes attendant on them, are here set forth in a lively and
entertaining Dialogue. Lucmu, in the Perstm ofANAcHAR s15, the Scythian,
laasghs, but with great good Humour, at the obvious Abficrdities, and ridiculous
Gz'rcungslances which sbmetimes accompanied them: whiss the Lawgiver defi’nds
