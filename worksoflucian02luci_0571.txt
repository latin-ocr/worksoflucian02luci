CHARIDEMUS. 565

to pass over that in filence, which is the perpetual object of our labour?
what proper use can we ever make of our eloquence, if we do not employ
it on that which best deserves our attention ἓ or, what can we do better than,
leaving every thing else, confine ourselves to the great aim and end of all?
But, lest it should be said that 1 dietate to others how they should acl, and,
at the same time, neglect it myself, 1 will say what Ican on this subject.

“ With regard to beauty, then, it is a perfeetion which all wish to obtain,
but very few are thought worthy to possess : those who do, are, doubtless,
the happiest of all beings, and honoured both by gods and rnen. Amongst
the deities, who, of heroes, were made gods, are Hercules, the son of Jove,
Castor and Pollux, and ³⁸⁵ Helen : the former, indeed, gained this pre-emi-
nence by virtue, but Helen acquired it by her beauty, and was not only
changed into a goddess herself, but immortalized her brothers also, who,
before her aseent into heaven, were numbered with the dead. U'e cannot,
moreover, find any mortals‚ but those who were remarkable for their
beauty, ever associated with the gods : for this, Pelops was permitted to tasle
ambrosia ; 'and with this, Ganymede, the son of Dardanus, gained such an
ascendency over the great Jupiter, who left all the deities, and fled with
him to Ida. So fond, we know, of beauty was the father of the goch,
that he not only honoured the poss'effors of it with a seat in heaven, bnt,
when he went down to earth, changed himself into a swan for Leda, into a
bul] for Europa, and, in Amphitryon’s shape‚ begot the immortal Hercules.
Every body knows the stratagems which he made use of to possess those he
loved. It is extraordinary that the poets should represent him to us as so se-
vere and impetuous in his converse with the gods, insomuch that, in his

⁴* Helen] Euripides, who was seldom over complaisant to the ladies, has, contrary to another
ancient authors, affured us, that this celebrated beauty was perfectly virtuous 3 that it was not she
who was carried away by Paris, but an image'or representation of her, framed by Juno, merely
to deceive him, and to revenge herself on the Trojan youth, for giving the apple to Venus.
The real Helen was, in the mean time, conveyed to Pharos, in AEgypt, where Menelaus found
her, on his return from the fiege of Troy, was reconciled to, and carried her back with him.—
On this strange story was founded the apotheosis of Helen, whom the Spartans, it seemS, wor-
shipped as a goddess, and erefled a temple to her. Herodotus, moreover, informs us, that the
ladies used to ‘invoke her aid, to make their children handsome3 and tells us a droll story of a
rich Spartan, who had a very ugly child: a person appeared to the nurse, and advised her to
carry it to the temple of Helen, from whence it returned a most beautiful girl, who was after-
wards married ro Aristo, king of Sparta. If this was really the case, and which, as we have

Herodotus's word for it, cannot be doubted, the temple of Helen, we may be amared, was al·
ways pretty well frequented.
