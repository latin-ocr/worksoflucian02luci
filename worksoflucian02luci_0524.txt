518 ENCOMIUM on DEMOSTHENES.

you know nor what to admire most : and thus it is with regard to the great
orator, whether you consider the spriglitliness os his wit, the force of his
eloquence, his tcmperance and fortitude, his contempt of riches, hisjustice, '·
humanity, good sense and discretiori in every woril and aetion. When you
call to mind his laws, his embasfies, his fleets 3 when you think on Megara,
Euboea, Boeotia, Chios, Rhodes, Byzantium, and the Hellespont‚ such a
variety of merit distraets you, and you know not which way to turn, or what
to fix first upon.
Thus Pindar, revolving various things in his mind, eries out,

Shall Ι of golden Melia, or of sweet
Ismenus sing, or Cadmus, or the sons

Of Sparta far renown'd, or flaming Thebes,
Or all-subduing Hercules, or chant

‘she chearful Bacchus, or the nuptial rites
Of fair Harmonia?

And, in like manner, you know not which first to celebrate, his eloquence,
or his life, his oratory, or his philosophy, his art of ruling anal ui221³ss⁵rir1ggthe
people, or his glorious death.

Ι would advise you, therefore, to take forne one particular, and try your
{kin upon that: compare his eloquence, for instance, to that: of Pericles,
which, we are told, was like thunder and lightning, that it left its sting
deeply fixed in the mind: it was not, however, so firm and solid; not such
as would stand the test of years z if you considered the virtues of his foul,
and his great ac‘ts for the service of the commonmal, you might single out
only two or three of them, which would afford you a fund sufficient. Ho-
mer often praises the particular parts of his heroes; their feet, head, or hait-3
their arms, or their sstields: and the gods themselves are celebrated by the
poets for the regis, or the dart.= You might praise Demosthenes, therefore,
for any fingle virtue or perfeffition ς as to celebrate them all would be a task
even for the great orator himself.

L Y C I N U S·

You mean, Ι suppose, by this encomium on Demosthenes, to convince me
that you are not only a poet, and can write good verses, but that you are an
orator, and can write excellent prose also.

THERSAGORAS.
