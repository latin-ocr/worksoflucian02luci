THE W I S H E S. 425

and let me remain your ’κ’ Antipater in Greecc, lcss‘, whilst 1 am leading
your troops round by Susa or Badria, an unlucky arrow may rcach sotne
part that is uncovered, and make an end of me.

Lycinus, I am afraid you are a coward: the law says, he who quits his
ranks must be punished with death; but now we are got to the Euphrates,
and every thing is safe behind, my governors are all appointed over every
people whom I have subdued3 others are dispatched to reduce Phoenicia,
Palaestine, and Egypt, you therefore may pass first over the bridge of boats ;
l shall follow you, and, after me, Timolaus, and last of all, you Adimantus
must take care of the horse: throughout Mesopotamia nobody will date to
oppose us, but all voluntarily surrender up themselves and their fortreffes,
proceeding then to Babylon, we shall get unexpecsstedly within their walls,
and take the city by surprize: the king, who is at Ctesiphon, hears of the
invafion, he goes to Seleucia, and prepares himself with a large body of
horse, archers, and ssingers ; my spies are come back, and inform sne that a
hundred milliens of fighting men are got together, two hundred thousand
of them skilled in throwingdarts from on horseback, though the Armenians,
the Baetrians, and those who inhabit near the Caspian sea were not yet
come up : so many thousands, however, without these, has he colle&ed to-
gether only in the neighbourhood of the city3 ·it behoves us therefore, my
friends, to look about us, and see what is to be done immediately.

l think your foot forces should retire to Ctesiphon, whilst I stay here with
the horse to take care of Babylon. .

S A M I P P U S.

Even you, Ifind, Adimantus, when you are in a post of danger begin to
tremble 3 but what says Timolaus?

T' “ 1 M o L Α U s.

‘That we should fall upon the enemy with our whole army, and not wait
till they are reinfor‘ced, and better prepared for us; let us attaek them whim

their allies are on the march hither.
S A M 1 P P U S.

You are in the right. Lycinus, what think you ?

Hellespont, left his general Antipater as his vicegerent in Europe.
