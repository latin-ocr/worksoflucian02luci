Afine sight you must have had; but how did the cities and the men

look?
MENIPPUS.

You have often seen a croud of ants running to and fro in and out of their
city, some turning up a bit of dung, others dragging a bean-shell‚ or run-
ning away with half a grain of wheat. 1 make no doubt but they have ar-
chitects, demagogues, senators, muficians, and philosophers amongst them.
Men, my friend, are exaitly like these: if you approve not of the compari-
sori, recollee't, if you please, the ancient Theffalian fables, and you will
find that the ³* Myrmidons, a most warlike nation, sprung originally from
pismires.

When Ι had thus seen and diverted myself with every thing, Ι shook my

wings, and ssew off, .
‘l'- To join the sacred senate of the skies.

Scarce had I gone a furlong‚ when the Moon, in a soft female voice, cried
out to me, “ Menippus, will you carry something for me to Jupiter, so
may your journey be prosperous.'’ “ With all my beart, said Ι, if it is nothing
very heavy.” “ Only a meffage, replied she, a small petition to him:
my patience is absolutely worn out by the philosophers, who are perpetually
disputing about me, whol am, of what fize, how it happens that l am
sometimes round and full, at others cut in half, some say l am inhabited,
others that 1 am only a looking-glass hanging over the sea, and a hundred
conjeffitures of this kind3 even my -i‘ light, they say, is none of my own,

u Pangaeus] A mountain of Thrace. Dion Caffius places it near Philippi. It was supposed
to have abounded in golden mines in some parts of it.

Ἃ· Myrmidons] When AEacus was king of Thessaly, his kingdom was almost depopulated by a
dreadful pestilence3 he prayed to Jupiter to avert the dillemper‚ and drenrned that he saw an
innumerable quantity ofants creep out ofan old oak, which were immediately turned into men ς
when he awoke‚ the dream was fulfilled, and he found his kingdom more populous than even
from that time the people were called Myrmidons. Such is the fable, which owed its rise mere<
ly to the name of Myrmidonis, which it was supposed must corne from μυρμηξ, an ant, or
pisinire -—-To some such trifling circumstances as these we are indebted for half the rables of
antiquity.

ἦ· Tojm'n, iffa] See Homer's iliad, book ἱ. l. 294.

ἶ My light.] This was the opinion of Anaxagoras, and is confirmed by the more accurate ob-
servations of modern philosophy.
