many bad consequences would afterwards arise from it: for the present,
however, Alcidamas was filenced‚ and, as he had threatened but just before,
laid himself down, half naked, on the floor, leaning his head on his arm,
with the cup in his hand, as they paint Hercules at the feast of the Centaurs.

The wine now went round; they drank to, and chatted with each other,
till at length lights were brought in; when 1 observed a pretty little girl
who stood behind cleodemus, fimpe‘ring at him (for Ι must tell you every
remarkable circumstance that happened on this occaslon), Ι watched nar-
rowly to find out what she laughed at, and next time ihc came near to take
the cup frorn him, I observed Cleodemus squeezing her hand, and purting,
some money into it; the girl smiled at the squeezing of her hand, but l be-
lieve did not feel the money, for two drachmas fell down between them,
and making a noise, which was overheard by the company, they both blush-

name, commanded silence, and fixing his eyes on the women, with a loud
voice cried out, “ Cleanthis, 1 drink to you, this is the cup of Hercules :''
at this the company laughed3 “ What do you laugh at, said he, becausel
drank to the bride, and called on Hercules ? But let me tell you, if {he does
not pledge me, she will never have a son like me, strong in body and mind,
and invincible;” saying this, he shewed part of his naked body in a most in-
decent mannen the guests laughed, and he got up in a violent paffion‚ and
looked so fierce and furious, that it was plain he did not mean to be quiet
much longer; he would certainly, indeed, have knocked down sornebody
with his club, if he had not, just in the nick of time, met with a fine cake,
which casting his eyes upon, he immediately grew calm, forgot his resent-
ment, and devoured it.

And now, many were got drunk, and the feast was nothing but noise and
clatnour. The rhetor-teian repeated some of his good things, at which the
