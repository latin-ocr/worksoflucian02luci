SWANSANDAMBER.

This lillle Plece is of the ſsime Nature with that which goes befbre it, but rather
more pleafimt‚ though only a kind ofjocular Pr'eface to fhme ftrious rhetorical
Declamantem wherein Lucum, always inclined to laugh at poetical Fables, ridi-
cules the Story, as told by Ov 1 D and others, oanAE'ron's Sssers turned into Poplars,
and paffi’s on to the old absscrd Relation qffinging Swans .· the latter Opinion, in-
deed, so univeisczlly received in the Heathen World‚ with regard to a Fa& si> con-
tradiffiory so Trmh and Eaperiense, is certainly a mqsl amazing Instance of the Power
proetiral Fifflon, and which has, never yet, I think, been properly accounted
for. This, by the Style and Manner, it may be observed, is certainly Lucmm’s ς
tlse preceding, mig-hl, perhaps, have been written by (ΠΨ bo& elft.

WAS told, l remember, when a boy, that amber was distilled from

poplar trees, that grew by the river Eridanus3 that these poplars were
formerly the fisters of Phaeton, who, whilst they lamented the loss of their
brother, were turned into trees, and that they, to this day, continue to fhed
these amber tears. Hearing the poers fing this story, Ι resolved, whenever
I had an opportunity of visiting Eridanus, to get under one of these poplars,
spread my lap, and catch a few drops of it: and not long fince, for a dif-
ferent purpose, having occafion to go that way, Ι sailed up the river Erida-
nus; but though 1 looked round as carefully as poffible, not a poplar, nor a
bit of arnber could I find there3 neither did the inhabitants so much as
know the name of Phaeton. When 1 asszed the failors how far it was to the
poplars that distilled amber, they laughed, and defired me to explain my-
self3 upon which, 1 told them the story of Phaeton3 that he was the son of
Apollo; that when he was grown up to be a young man, he begged to
drive his father's chariot for a day3 that he was thrown out, and perifhed in
the attempt; and that his szsters were turned into poplars by the fide of that
river, where he fell, and {hed tears of amber.

‘⁶ What lying impostor, replied they, could tell you this? We have never
seen this coachman of your's fall into the river, neither have we any of those
poplars which you talk of: if there was such a thing, do you think we
would work here for people, and row boats up against the stream, when
we might so soon get rich, by catching the tears of poplars ?” This speech rnor-
tified me not a little; 1 held my tongue‚ and was assramed, to think, that,
like a boy, I should give any credit to poets, who deal in nothing but lies. Ι
