ENCOMIUM oN A FLY.

Y here is scarce any Subje5?‚ however trffling and irfing‘ficant, which in the Hands os
Genius may not afford stmte Entertainment; even an ENCOMIUM οΝ Α F ιγ by
LuchN‚ is not zerithout Aderit. One of our own great Wts, has, in like Man-
ner, taken the Pains to be ve7y facetious upon N0T31NG3 aad another has given
us a Dffirtation on A Baoomsnex. Of the fietne Nature is the sportive Play of
Fancy which we meet with in this little Piece, where our Sayrss appears in the
new Charaffier of a Naturalist, which he sapports with a tolerable Degree of ac·
curate &sto-vatim, with regat-d to the Form and Qalities of the diminutive Hero,

whom he has thought proper to immortalize. His Application to the Doftrine qs
PLATo has much Humour in it.

HE fly, compared to gnats and other small inseffih, is, by no meane,

the least of ἦ birds, but as much bigger than them, as it is, itself,

less than the bee 3 it is, withal, fledged in a different manner, having a kind
of hair all over its body, though the feathers are thicker on its wings: like
locusts, grasshoppers, and bees, its pinions are as much softer than all others,
as the Indian habit is lighter and more delicate than the Grecian. If you
look close to it, you will observe that it has as many beautiful colours as the
peacock, when he expands his wings to the sun, and begins his flight; when
he flies, he does not flap the air about with his wings like a bat, nor leap
like the locust, or make a bumming like the wasp, but skims softly and gently
through the air ; he fings a kind of song, not disagreeable, like the goat, with
the heavy noise of a bee, or the threatning found of the wasp„ but as much
sweeter and more harmonicus than them, as the pipe is, in comparison with
the cymba] or the trilmpet. Its head is notjoined close to the bodyas the locust's
is, but separated by a small neck, and turns round with ease: the eyes stand our,
and are transparent like horn3 the body is round and comperet, and the legs
coming out of it, not short, as the wasp’s are, but long and free; and the
belly guarded, as it were, with plates, like a coat of mail. It defends and
revenges itself, not by a sting at the extremity of the body, but with a pro—
boscis, which it makes use of, like the elephant, to seed itself with, and to

lay hold of any thing3 with this it pricks, and draws the blood, which it
