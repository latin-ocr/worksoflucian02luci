158 JUPITER 'ruz TRAGEDIAN.

M Ι N E R V A.
’Χ Say, king of gods and men, Saturnian Jove,
Behold Minerva, blue-ey’d goddess, thee
Suppliant adores ι O give her but to know
Thy inmost grief·, whence spring these dreadful groans,
Why spreads that paleness o’er thy face divine ?

JUP1T“EK

ἦν There‘s not an ill, a sorrow, or a pain,
No sad event, in tragic story told,
Which gods have not experienced3 nought that’s wretched,
Which our unhappy nature doth not feel.

M 1 N E R V A.
Heav’ns! what a prologue!

JUPIT’EK
Impious, earth-born racc,

And thou, Prometheus, what a train of ills
Didst thou procure me ἔ

Μ Ι Ν E R V A.
Tell us, for thou speak'st

To thy best friends, thy fellow-deities.

U P 1 T E R.
ἶ What hast thou doiie for me, thou noisy thunder ,ὃ

Μ Ι N E R V A.
Do not be angry with us, good Jupiter, if not having swallowed all Eu-
ripides, we should find ourselves unable to tragedize with you-

juria
Do you think 1 do not know what is the cause of all this weeping and

wailing?

JUP1T*EK
O ἱ if thou didst, ’twou’d fill thy eyes with team-

ἃ Sty, king. kh] Minerva, not to be behind hand in complaisauce, appeals to Jupiter in

hexameters. Her speech is a little kind of cento, taken from various parts of Homer, and put
together ad libitum.

† There’s not, &c ] From the Orestes of Euripides, with a little variation.

1 1νῖ ‘hat lust, δικ] This is either from some old poet, whose works are not come down to
us, or an imitation by Lucian himself.
