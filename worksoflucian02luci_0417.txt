ADISPUTEwtrul—IESIOD. 1211

must turn up the earth with a spade, and cover the seed, or the birds will
fly upon ir, and devour all the hopes of your rifing harvest: he who gives
you such precepts, will certainly be in the right ; but this is a very different
thing from divination, which pries into obscurity, and can sorctel what is
by no means plain or easy to be discovered : as when it was predidh‘d to
Minos that his son should be suffocated in a tub of honey3 when the cause
of ²* Apollo's anger was foretold to the Grecians, and that Troy would be
taken in ten years: this, Igrant yon, is divination; but if what I men—
tioned before is to be called by that name, l can be a prophet myself; for 1
will‘divine and foretel‚ and without Castalian water, murel, or Delphic tri—
pod, that if a man walks naked in the cold, whilst it rains and hails, he
shall be seizcd with a violent shivering‚ and, which is rnore wonderful, [hall
grow very hot afterwards: thisI could affert, with a thousand other such
thingS, too ridiculous to mention.

Let us, therefore, lbeseech you, have no more of this defence, or this
divination: What you said, indeed, at first, we may possibly admit, and
allow that you knew nothing yourself about what you talked of, the verses
being dietated to you by a divine inspiration; but this is a poor argument,
as it will never account for half the Muses’ promise being fumum, and the
ψ other half never performed.

δ’· Apello’s anger-J See Homer's Iliad, ix. 63.

-j- The other, δα] The dialogue, which was just growing warm and lively, here ends most
abrupssy, and is a convincing proof that this piece is nothing buta fragment: time or accident
have stolen away the rest of it.
