first speech to Juno, who used to reproach him for his amours‚ he so terri·
fied her, that she seemed happy his anger was confined to words alone ; and,

in the next, all the dcities were struck with terror, when he threatened to
hang up earth and sea ε and yet this terrible god, when he addreffed the fair,

was rnild, gentle, and kind to all; laid aside the deity, lest he should ap.
pear disgustful to thern, and affumed the most beautiful forms to 'entice them ;
such deference and respe& did he always pay to beauty.

But lest, it should be objeeted that we speak of this rather to find fault
with Jupiter, than for the honour and praise of beauty‚ most certain it is,
as all who rene& must acknowlege‚ that all the deities were as fond of beauty
as Jove himself. ἥ Neptune was struck with the form of Pelop5‚ Apollo
admired Hyacinthus, and Cadmus was the favourite of Mercury.

The goddesses also blush not to acknowlege the power of beauty‚ and
yield their charms to the handsomest men : there is no quarrel amongst them
sor precedency, on any other account. Minerva presides over war, and
leaves hunting to Diana3 Juno takes care of nuptial affairs, and contends
not with Venus, who guards what is committed to her care : but in beauty‚
they would all be thought to excel, and each imagines herself, in that, su-
perior to all the rest. The goddess Strife, who wishes to see them destroy
each other, makes use of no means but this to carry on her defigns against
them. This, alone, might suffice to prove the power of 'beauty: for no
sooner was the apple seen, and the »ᾗ inscription on it, than each believed it
must belong to her, and that every vote would be in her favour. To Ju-
piter, the brother and husband of one of them, and father of the others,
they referred the cause: but though he could so easily have decided it,
though there were so many able and learned judges of it, both amongst the
Greeks and Barbarians, he submitted it to Paris; by that, alone, determin-
ing the superiority of beauty over strength and wisdom. So great was their
, ambition to be thought beautiful, that they persuaded the great poet, who
fings of gods and heroes, to distinguish them rather on that account
than any other. Juno took more pleasure in the epithet of ,ἶ white-
armed‚ than in being called the venerable goddess, or daughter of
