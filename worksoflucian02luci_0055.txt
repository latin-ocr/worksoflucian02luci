osDANCINQ 49

Amazing strength these poisons to sustain.

For sustain them you will: you need not be afraid of having an ass’s head,
or a hog's beart, for your understanding will be improved, and you will be
for putting the cup to your friends, over and over : for what ᾗ Homer says
of Mercury’s golden rod, that it

causes sseep to fly,
And in soft ssumber seals the wakeful eye,

may be applied to dancing; it pleases the eye, makes men watchful, and
awakens thern to every thing they ought to do.

CRATO.

Lycinus‚ I am a convert to your opinion, my eyes and ears are open and
attentive: therefore, remember, rny friend, when you go to the theatre,
thatI take a place next to you, that you may not come out from thence so
much wiser than myself.

ἶ Homer-J See Pope's Odyffey, book v. l. 60.
