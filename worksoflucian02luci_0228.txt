therby the eam, not content with abusing him, and calling him a hot stone,
and a mass of fire. In the mean time, I am no stranger to what these men,
who look so grave and sower all day, are doing o'nights; but 1 see and say
nothing, not thinking it decent tolay open their vile and abominable lives to
the public; for when 1 catch them committing adultery, thieving, or prac-

at the door: Mercury heard me, and asking my name, went off imme·
(nuely, and carried it to his master; soon after I was let in, and, trembling
and quaking with fear, found all the gods fitting together, and seemingly
not a little alarmed at my appearance there, expedfing, probably, that they
should soon have a number of winged mortals travelling up to them in the

same manner: when Jupiter, looking at me with a most severe and ’ᾗ Ti-
tanic countenance, cried out,
