SATURNALIAN EPISTLES:

Tflss POOR MAN's PETITION.

To SATURN HEALTH.

If LuchN has a Fault it is perhaps, that of‘sbmetimes dwelling too long on a Sub-
fiet, and ſslueeziftg it, like ovid, to its lafi Dregs. ‘This seems to be the Cas} with
regard to the Saturnalia, the Ridicule of which he is loth to part with, and has

ihamefully unequal3 some strut in high shoes, which fortune helps them to,

and trample upon us with tragic pomp and insolence, whilst we,crawl upon
