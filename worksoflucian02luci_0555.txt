bream {he who ssew the giants: you have nothing, lhope, to say against

her?
TRIEPHON.

Perhaps Ι may, if you will attend to me.

TRIEPHON.

Tell me, then, what use is the Gorgon of, and why does Minerva wear it

'at her breast?
¹ C R 1 Τ I A S.

To look terrible, and, at the same time, as a defence against every evil ι

with this she frightens her enemies, and turns the vietory to which ever

fide {he pleases. Τ R Ι E Ρ H O N

And is it this which makes her invincible ?

eR1T1AS.

Certainly. T R 1 E Ρ H 0 N.

Why, therefore, do not we offer up our bulls and· goats rather to that
which defends, than that which is defended, if we wish to be as invincible

asMinerva?
C R 1 T 1 A S.

The Gorgon has not a power of aiding and affisting at all distances, as-
the gods have 3 but if one of them wears it, ancl then only, it is of service.

T R 1 E P H 0 N.
And what was this Gorgon? I should be glad to learn that from you,

who are sscilled in things of this kind : for my own part, I arn a stranger to
every thing about it, but the name.

C R 1 Τ 1 A S.
She was a fair and most beautiful virgin 3 and Perseus, a valiant hero, and

{killed in the magio art, subdued her by his incantationS, and cut off her
head3 ever fince which she bath been used as a charm by the gods.

T R 1 E P H O N.
It is unaccountable to me, hotv the gods can stand in need of the affist-

ance of mortals3 but, when she was alive, was she really a virgin, or did
the only pass for one?
