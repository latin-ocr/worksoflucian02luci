CRATO..

In good truth, my friend Lycium, Ι am astonished to see a man 11kc yon,
brought up to letters, and no bad philosopher, leaving his profitahle studies.
and converse with the ancients, to be tickled with a fiaigeoler, or fit admir-
ing an effeminate fellow, in long petticoats‚ finging lascivious songs‚ aiz-(l
imitating the lewd women, the ’ὦ Phaedras, Parthenopes, and Rhodopes os
antiquity‚ beating time with your foot upon the benches, and making a ri-
diculous noise, very unbecoming a man of your education. When 1 heard
you frequented such entertainrnents‚ I not only bluffied for, but was truly
angry with you, for thus neglee‘ting Plato, Aristotle, and Chrysippus, to sn·
like those who tickle their ears with a feather3 and that too whilst there are-
s0 many noble and delightful employments for the eye and ear, so many
excellent concerts‚ so many, where the vi} harp is played on in perfeetion, and
above -all, whilst there is grave tragedy and chearful comedy to amuse you,
things worthy of public contest, and universal emulation. You will stand
in need, therefore, my good friend, of a long apology, at least with every
liberal mind, if you mean not to be cut offfrom the society of all good and
virtuous men: you had better, indeed, at once, deny that you were ever
¹guilty of such a folly; and take care that, for the future, we never see you
changing yourself thus, from a man into a* Lydian or Bacchanal; it would
be not only your fault, indeed, but ourS, if, when we saw you stupified‚
like ,ἶ Ulyffes by the lotus, we did not endeavour to bring you back to your
sense3‚ before you were totally poffeffed by those Syrens of the stage3 his
Syrens caught mariners by the ears, if they did not stop thern up with wax,
as they sailed that way3 but you are taken by the eye, and reduced to the

most abje& ssavery.

’ Phaedras, [fici] The story of Phaedra, and her passion for Hippolytus, is too well known
to stand in need of any illustration. Parthenope was one of the Syrens whom Ulysses ssrnt 'nis
ears against. The last mentioned lady is reported to have got money enough, by her
profeffion as a courtezan‚ to build one of the famous AEgyptian pyramids‘²

† The hat-p] Greek κιθαρα. Ι call it a harp, though, as Montfaucou has observed, it is very
difficult to determine in what the lyre, cithara, chelys. psaltery‚ and harp differed from each
other. Dr. Burney observes, that the cithara (from which the Italian word chitarra, or guit-
tar, is manifestly derived), was, perhaps, as different from the lyre‚ us a fingle harp froin ι
doubleone. The Greeks had, probably, two principal species of ssringed instrumenta, one,
like our harp‚ of full compass, test—ing on its base, the other more portable, and ilnng over ὼε
ssmulder, like our guittar, or the ancient lyre, represented in sculpture.

Pope, in another place.
