'rna GOUT-TRAGEDY. 585

Thou wert not worthy of respe& or honour,
Nor hadst dominion o'er the lives of rnen.
Wherefore with all due speed, in five days time,
Not less than two long stadia have 1 travell'd,

And brought them hither.

Well hast thou flown3 but say, through what rough ways

Of five bad staveS, whose timbers {hook beneath me,

With ease.-But, what are you ? by gods and men

My pow'r invincible: say, know ye not,
That Ι have conquer’d ev’n Saturnian Jove,
Subdu’d unnurnber'd heroes? mighty Priam,
