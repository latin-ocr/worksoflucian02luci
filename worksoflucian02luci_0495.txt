what fine doings are these, and, no doubt, highly becoming and proper

for such a festival !''

‘⁶ By Jove, said Hermon, who sate next above him, it: is most excellent3
he had heard, 1 suppose, that Aristaenetus had a boar for supper, and this
put him in mind of the Caledoniam : in good truth, you should send him a
ssice of it, lest, like Meleager, he should die with hunger3 though one
would think he should be safe from that, as Chrysippus and his Stoics held ali
these things to be indifferent.”

Zenothemis then, rifing up, roared out, “ How dare you abuseChryfippusb*
because one man is an impostor, have you a right to condemn all the restg
or, because Etaemocles does not speak like a philosopher, are you to abuse
Zeno and Cleanthes, men of sense and cliarad‘ter? Did not you, Hermon,
cut off the golden locks from the statue of Castor, and had not you like to

have suffered for it? did not you, cleodemus, debauch the wife of your '

scholar Sostratus, and did not you undergo a certain shameful punishment
for it ?'' “ 1 am not bawd, however, to my own wife, (replied Cleodemus,)
as some folks are; nor did Ι take a stranget's money to keep sor him, and
afterwards swear that I never received it; nor do I take fifty per cent. on
usury, nor wring my scholar’s necks when they don't pay me.'' “ You can-
not deny, said Zenothemis, but that you sold a certain‘liquor to Crato to
poison his father with.'' He then drank half a glass of wine, and threw the
rest in his face, part. of it falling on lon, who happened unfortunately to fit
near him. Hermon wiped the wine off his head, and called on the company
to bear witness of the affront he had received. Cleodemus, who had no
glass, turned about, and spit upon Zenothemis, then laying hold on his
beard with his left hand, beat him with the other in such a manner,
that he would inevitably have killed the old man, if Aristaenetus had not
interposed, thrown himself between the combatants, and put an end to the
stay. i

I could not bean eye-witness of these thi'ngS, my dear Philo, without re-
flecting, as every one would naturally do, of how little service it isto be
wife and learned, unless it influences our lives and manners. W’hen 1 saw
some of the greatest scholars in the kingdom guilty of *actions that made
them so ridiculous, 1 could not help thinking, that, as the vulgar say,
