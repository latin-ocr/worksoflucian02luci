248 THEDOUBLEINDICTMENT.'

diffusive mode of speech which I learned from her, Ι shall be brief in my
reply. lwill satify you, however, with regard to every article which she
has alleged against me. What she told you about me, 1 acknowlege was all
t1·ue; she instruenti, travelled with me, and introduced me to the best com-
pany in Greece; on all these accounts the conneffion was most agreeable to
me; and now you {hall hear why 1 lest her, and fixed my affections on the
lovely Dialogue; do not imagine 1 would be guilty of the least degree of
salsehood to support my cause.

Know then, that when [perceived {he no longer behaved with that tem-
perance and sobriety‚ or appeared in that decent habit, which she wore when
wedded to the Ἄ· Paeanian orator, but tricked herself out like a harlot, plaited
her hair, and painted her cheeks, I began to suspe&‚ and watched her nar-
roxvly; but Ι will not mention :1111 sawg suffice it to say, that every night
the street was filled with drunken lovers, who came to revel with her,
knocking perpetually at her door, and some of them breaking in with rude
force and violence, ss1e seeming all the while to laugh at, and be pleased
with them for it3 frequently would she look down upon them from her
windOW‚ and listen to their amorous ditties; nay even sometimes open
her door, and little thinking 1 knew any thing of it, play the wanton with
them. 1 did not choose openly to accuse her of adultery, but not being able
to bear such treatment, betook myself to Dialogue, who lived in the neigh-
bourhood, and who, I thought, would with open arms receive me. These
are all the great injur-ies which 1 have done to Rhetoric3 but even, if she had
not aeted in this manner, surely, Sirs, an old man, on the verge of forty,
might be permitted to retire from strife and bustle, and end his days in peace;
to ihelter himself both from the accusations of tyrants, and the applauses of
the great3 and, no longer ambitious os fame or admiration, to seek the Ly-
caeum or Academy, and converse there peaceably with my friend Dialogue.

And nOW, having nothing more to say, 1 submit to your equitable determi-

nation.
