THEFUGITIVES. 45¹

ners, with regard to externat appearances, you well know, are easily imi-
tated; it is no great hardship to put on an old cloak, to carry a bag at one's
fide, and a club in one’s hand, to make a noise, or rather to bark at, and
abuse every body. They would not live now upon plain pulse and coarse
food, as they did before on herbs and ffllads, but ssesh of all kinds, and the
finest wine; they colledted a tribute wherever they went, or as they called it,
{heered their sheep, every body giving them something, either out of res-
pect, or for fear they should be abused by them} they thought, no doubt,
they had an equal right to all advantages with the true philosophers; nor is
it every one who can discern the difference, where externals are alike. If
you enquire too strictly into their character, they have recourse immediately to
abuse and violence: if you find fault with their lives, they refer you to their
doctrine, and if you dissike their dofitrine‚ they desire you to confidet their
lives.

The whole city abounds with impostors of this kind, especially amongst
the followers of Diogenes, Crates, and Antisthenes, all those who fight
under Cynic banners ε these never imitate that vigilance, that domestic carc
and attention, that mernory, that love of their master, which dogs are so
remarkable for3 but their barking‚ their greediness, their gluttony‚ their
lust, their fawning, flattery, and love of a good tab1e; these are canine
qualities‚ which they are great proficients in.

You may easily foresee what will be the consequence of this ε men will
quit their shops, and leave the arts uncultivated, when they find that, though
they labour from morning to night, they cannot support themselves3 whilst
a set of idle impostore can live in affluence, take what they please, be angry
at those who will not give, and scarce thankful to those who do ι this must
appear a golden age to thern3 the honey flows into their mouths ⁴⁵ from
heaven.

The evil would be tolerable if it ended here; but these wretches, grave
and demure as they appear outwardly‚ if they can get a beautiful woman,
what they do 1ss1a11 not mention. Some of them have been familiar with
the wives of their hosts, like the famous † Trojan youth, merely, l suppose,

⁶ From heaven.] This seems to allude to the feeding of the Israelites with manna. How
Lucian came to do this, is not eafily to be accounted for.

† Trqjanyouth.] Paris, so well known in ancient story for his love of Helen, tlte wire oi
Menelaus.
