114 TOXARIS.

proper to eneamp thern on both banks of the Tanais. They took a great
deal of spoil, plundered our tents, seized on our carriages, with the drivers,
and ravished our women before our eyes, whilst all we could do was to la*
ment our misfortunes.

Amizoces, being amongst the rest taken prisoner, an'd bound in chains,
called loudly on his friend, reminding him of the solemn bond, and the
bloody bowl: Dandamis heard his eries, and immediately leaped into the
river, and swam towards the enemy; the Sauromatians observing, levelled
their arrows at him ε when he cried out, Ziris ! this, if any one repeats‚ he
is never ssain, as they conclude he comes to redeem a captive: he was ac-
cordingly carried to the general, and demanded the restitution of his friend;
they signified to him that a very large ransom would be expec‘ted, if they let
him go: upon which Dandam-is said, ‘⁶ Every thing which I had you have
already taken from me, if, naked and destitute as lam, there is aught
which you will accept, command, and I obey: take me instead of him,
and do what you will with mest “ We want not, replied one of thern, your
entire person, especially as you came asuppliant‚ but must have a part, ifyou
would redeem your friend.” “ What part, said Dandamis do you require ?’''
they insisted on his eyeS, which were immediately taken from him ;. and he
then took his friend, leaned on, and swam over with him safe to our camp.

This aetion so animated and encouraged our troops, that they no longer
considered themselves as vanquished, when they saw that the greatest of hu-
man bleffings was not taken from them, but that there still remained in Scy-
thia a noble mind, and the confidence of disinterested friendship: nor did
it fail to astonish and terrify our enemies, when they reflected what kind of
men they had to contend with hereafter, and how they would sight when
prepared, though when thus taken at unawares, they had so easily subdued
them : the very next night, therefore, leaving a great quantity of their
cattle, and setting fire to the carriages, they retreated. Amizoces could·
not bear the thought of enjoying his sight, whilst Dandamis was deprived of
it, but put out his own eyes; and they now fit together, are maintained at
the public expence, and held in the highest esteem and veneration by every
Scythian. ⁶

Can you, Mxoefippus, produce any thing equal to this? no, not if you
were to bring ten more, besides your other sive, and without swearing to the
truth of them, I have told you nothing but the plain naked fact. If you.
