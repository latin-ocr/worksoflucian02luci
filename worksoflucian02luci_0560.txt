But can ²³÷‘ only
Lament his son, by great Patroclus ssain.

You can say nothing, therefore, concerning thern, even though you could
be snarched up to heaven with your new master, and initiated into his mys-

teries.

But how happens it that the same poet mentions a doubtful fate, and tells
us, that if a man does such a thing it shall be attended with such and such
consequences ? and if he does the contrary, with something very different from
it, as with regard to † Achilles, who says of himself,

My fares long fince by Thetis were disclos’d,
And each, alternate, life or farne propos'd;
Here, if 1 stay, before the Trojan town,
Short is my date, but deathless my renown ·,
If lterum, Iquit immortal praise,

For years on years, and long-extended days,

’rhen again, as to ξιξ Euchanor,

Oft had the father told his early doom,
By arms abroad, or ssow disease at home.

ls not all this in Homer? Can any thing be more ambiguous, or carry with
it a stronger appearance of deceit? And here we may add the speech of Ju—
piter himself: does not he tell AEgisthus himself, that if he abstained from
adultery‚ and the murther of Agamemnon, the Fates had decreed him a
long life; but that if he committed those crimes, he should die suddenly ?³
l have osten prophefied, myself, in this manner, if you kill any body, you
must expe& that Nemesis will overtake you; but if you do not, you shall

live :
ᾗ Nor {halt thou soon the destin'd period find,

Do nor you plainly see by all this, how ambiguous, idle, and ill-founded
all the fictions of the poets are? pay no regard to them, therefore, for the
future3 if you expe& to be enrolled in the list of the good and virtuous.
