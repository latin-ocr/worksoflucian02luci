'216 1CARO-MEN1PPUS.

represented as probable‚ and the fable-writer 3‘ AEsop confirmed it, who car-
ries up, not only his eagles, but his beetles, and camels thither. To make
wings for mysdf, was impossible, but to fit those of a vultur and an eagle to
my body, might, 1 imagined, answer the same purpose. I resolved, there-
fore, to try the experiment‚ and cut offthe right wing of one, and the left
of the other; bound them on with thongs‚ and at the extremities made
loops for my hands3 then raising myself by degrees, just skimmed above
the ground, like the geese. When finding my proje& succeed, Imade a
bold push, got upon the ej* Acropolis, and from thence ssid down to the
theatre. Having got so far without danger or difficulty, Ibegan to medi-
tate greater things, and setting off from 2 Parnethes or Hymettus, flew to
ᾗ Gemma, and from thence to the top os the tower at Corinth, from thence
over Η Pholoe and Frymanthus, quite to Taygetus. And noui, resolving to
strike a bold stroke, asl was already become a high flyer, and perfect in my
art, l no longer confined myself to chicken flights, but getting upon Olym-
pus, and taking a little light provision with me, 1 made the best of my way
discetly towards heaven : the extreme height which I soared to brought on
a giticliness at first, but this soon went off: and whenI got as far as the
moon, having left a number of clouds behind me, 1 found a weariness‚ par-

ticularly in my vultur wing; I hulted, therefore, to rest myself a little, and

looking down from thence upon the earth, like Homer’s Jupiter, beheld
the places

4 W'here the brave Mycians prove their martial force,
And hardy Thracians tame the savage horse3
Then India, Persia, and all-conqu'ring Greece.

which gave me wonderful pleasure and satisfacition.
