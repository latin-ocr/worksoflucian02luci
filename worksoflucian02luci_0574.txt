568 CHARIDEMUS.

dignity and importance, there is nothing ridiculous in my attempting to
speak concerning it, even after Philo.

Beauty has something in it so nobie, and so divine, that (to pass over the
honour in which it was held by the gods, and confine myself to its power
over men), Helen, the daughter of jove,x even before she had reached the
age of maturity, was universally admired‚ insomuch that Theseus, who
came to transmit some affairs in Peloponnesus, fell so violently in love with
her, that, though possessed of a most noble kingdom, and crowned with
glory, he thought there was no joy in life without her, and that if he could
gain her for a wife he should be the happiest of mankind. As she was under
age, he could have no hopes of her father’s consent, he left his own king·
dom, defied all the power of Peloponnesus, and took her away from her fa-
ther, by soree of arms, and carried her to Aphidna, with the affistance of
Pirithous, whom he ever after so loved and valued on that account, that the
friendship of Theseus and Pirithous is handed down as an example to pos-
terity. XVhen he went down to hell, in pursuit of Proserpine, Theseus,
after in vain endeavouring to diffunde h'rm from the enterprize‚ accompa-
nied, and ran the hazard of his life to serve him in it. When she returned,
in her riper years, to Argos, in the absence of Theseus, the Grecian
princes, though they had the finest and most beautiful women of their own,
were all eager to possess hei-3 but fearing, as they were all ready to fight for
her, that a civil war would ensue, they bound themselves by a common
cinth, jointly to defend him who should be thought worthy of her, and not
to suffer any to attack or injure him3 every one'flattering himself that this
might be his own happy lot: but all, except Menelaus, were disappointed.
They abided, however, by their agreement. When, not long aster, the
dispute arose among the goddesses, which of ‘them was the most beautiful,
and the decifion was left to Paris3 who, suspended by the charms of
the candidates, and by the bribes they offered him, knew not how to
determine: for Juno promised him the kingdom of Afia, Minerva perpe-
tual vifflny in war, and Venus the poffeffion of Helen: refleRing‚ at length,
that empire might fall to the meanest and most unworthy, but that Helen
could not ³* descend t'o posterity, he preferred the enjoyment of her.

¹¹·- Dqfiwd] This is a new and ingenious desence of Paris’s choice. Too much, however, is
{ald in this part of the dialogue about Helen, which smells too much, we must own, of the
schol-,istic lamp, and confirms my observation eoneerning it.
