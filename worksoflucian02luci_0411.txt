This is a familiar Letter of LucrAN's to a particular Friend ( but who the Friend
was we know not), giving him a carious Destription of a little Serpent called
the Dipsas, which is fhtmd in the Desarls of Libya. The Dqfiviption is
lively and plfiureffiuaess and the complimentmy Turn at the End in the true Spirit of
LUCI AN, and much the prettier for being quite unexpefied.

HE southern parts of Libya are nothing but one imm-ense plain or de—

sart, where the earth is burned up, and quite barren, without grass,
plant, or water upon it; in the hollows of rocks, indeed, you may some-
times meet with the remnants of a fhower, but it is thick, and of so fetid a
smell, that no man can drink of it be he ever so thirsty, it is therefore un-
inhabited3 who, indeed, can live in a place which is for ever dry, barren,
and stinking‚ where there are perpetual vapours, and where the air is as hot
as fire, and the burning sends render the whole country impaffable ? the Ga·
ramantes alone, a savage people, who go thinly clad, and live in tentS, are
found there in winter time3 when the sand is hardcned by the rains, and the
heat a little abated‚ they watch the season, and come to hunt wild affes, and
ostriches, that fly close to the ground, apes, and sometimes elephants; for
these of all creatures can best endure thirst, and the tortures of a burning
sun: but even there people get back as fast as they can, as they are ailnays
in fear lest the hot sand should, as it osten does, put a stop to their
journey, catch them as it were in a net, and totally destroy then]; nor
is there, to say the truth, any poffibility of escaping, when the sun drawing
up the moisture, and drying up every thing in a moment, flames out in all
his fierceness, and seems to {hoot forth stronger rays, and to gather strength
from the moisture he has exhaled‚ which adds fuel to his fire. Dreadful as»
this drought and solitude‚ this want of every thing useful and necessary,
and these pestilential vapourS, are, they are still less so than what I am going to
mention, and which alone might sufficiently deter us from entering into this
inhospitable regiom and that is, the quantity ofserpents with which* it abound55
many of thern of an immense fize, strange forms, and armed with a most
deadly and destructive poison, some creeping on the surface of the earth, and

others
