3521LL1TERATE BOOK-HUNTER.

than yourself, but mere barbarians in literature, and equally deficient in
knowlege and understanding‚ as it is most probable those will always be,
who know not good from evil: and yet you, perhaps, have only bought
two or three books from them, which they are handling day and night, and,
consequently‚ must be much more learned thari you.

For what reason, then, can you possibly buy thern, unless you think that
the very cases that contain the writings' of so many celebrated ancients must
inspire learning? But answer me, l beg, or, if you cannot do that, give rne
a nod, or shake os the head, to fignify your assent or dissent to what I shall
ask you: Do you really think, if a man who knew nothing of the flute, was
to purchale that nhich ²' Ismeniae or “iv Timotheus had, and which he gave
seven talents for at Cerinth, that he would immediately be ableto play well
upon, and sing to it, or that, rather, on the other hand, the poffeffion of it
would be of no service to him who was not skilled in the art beforehand?
that shake of the head acknowleges the latter: neither, if he had never learn-
ed, would he sing, though he had got the pipe of Marsyas or Olympus.
Had a man the bow ard arrows of Hercules, and was not a ’ξ Philoctetes,
could he make use os them, or, if he did, could he ever hit the mark, would
he perform the office of a {kilful archer? what say you? you shake your
head at this also. In like manner, were he who knows nothing of piloting
to purchase the most beautiful veffeI, and fit it out, with every thing, both
useful and ornament-al3 or, were he, who is equally unsszilled in riding, to
buy ᾗ a Kappaphorian, a Mediam, or a Η Theffalian steed, would either of
these, not knowing how to make use os what they had, be ever the better

⁴* [streniae] A famous player on the riute, mentioned by Plutarch, Xenophon, and other
ancient writers.

† Timotlrm] For an account ofthis famous mulieian, I refer the reader to the ingenious Dr.
Buruey’s inost excellent and entertaining History of Mufic ; where he will likewise meet with
some amuling particulars, with regard to Marsyas and Olympus„

ζ Α ememtes] Hercules, we are told, at his death on mount Hyllus, bequeathed to Phi-
loe‘letes, as a testimony ot* his esteeni‚ his bow and arrows: without the possession of these, the
Greeks were inforined hyan oracle, that Troy could never be conquered On this subje& was
formed the l'hiloc‘tetes ofSophocleS. See my transsation of Sophocles, and the notes on Philo&etes.

ξ A Ix'asqtvaplwrian.] Gr. Κκππαφορω, i. e. a horse marked with a kappa or K, burned
in on the thigh: horses thus marked were coumed the most valuable: the Median mares were
likewise in high esteem.

ῃ Thffzliau.] Gr. Κειταυμδην, de stirpe Centauri. The Centaurs inhabited the mountains
in the neighbourhood of Thessaly. The story of the Centaurs is well known ‚- their supposed

descendants must, doubtless, have been creatures of extraordinary merit. f
