APOPHRAS. 3⁷7

plainly shewed that it had been long fince plannetl and writen ; though his
impudence helped him out greatly, and gave force to his action, and favoured
the deceit: mean time, the audience laughed heartily, some looked towards
his friend, as much as to say, they knew he was privy to the imposture;
others, who perceived what he was about, were employed in recollefflng,
one for the other, the passages from the several sophists who had declaimed
in former times. Amongst the laughers was the ἦ person who writes this,
and who smiled, as well he might, at such amazing impudence; and, as
the other, in a soft voice, was chaunting what he called a Threnodium of
Pythagoras, burst into a loud laugh, at seeing an ass thus attempting to
thrurn the lyre3 the finger turning round, 'observed him, and this brought
on a quarrel between thern.

It was now the beginning of the year, or, to speak more properly, the
ἦ· third day from the great calends, when the Romans, according to an-
cient custom, as prescribed by Numa, offer sacrifice and prayers for the
whole year, and believe, that the gods on that day, will be always propiti-
ous to them. At this tirne it was, that our friend, who had laughed so
heartily at this false Pythagoras, and who well knew how infamous a fellow
he was, turning to an acquaintance, cried out, ‘⁶ Let us get out of the com-
pany of this vile actor, who prophanes our meeting‚ and turns our best of
days into an apophras, or un'lucky one.’' Upon which, our sophist hearing
the word Apophras, began to ridicule it as a foreign phrase, and unknown
to the Greeks 3 “ What, says he, can this Apophras be? is it a fruit, or
an herb, or a veffel, or something to eat or drink? for Ι have never heard
of'it'before, nor do lunderstand what he can mean by it.” Thus did he

η continue to ridicule and abuse our Apophras, not aware, that, in so doing,
he only exposed himself. My poet has, for that purpose, wrote this book
and sent me to you, to prove this noble sophist knows nothing even of what
every illiterate tradesman in Greece is thoroughly acquainted with.

Thus far Elenehus3 the rest of the fable belongs to me, and Ι can, my-
self, proclaim with no less truth than the Delphic tripod, all your actions :
