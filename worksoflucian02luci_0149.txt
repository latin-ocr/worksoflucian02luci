1, in the mean time, led a most pleasant and luxurious life : by the help
of my ἦ accustomed food, my body grew sseek and handsome, my hair
sofr, and rny ikin smooth z my worthy masters, perceiving how fat and fine
I was, and at the same time observing that the barley was not eat, but re.
mained untouched, began tp entertain some suspicion of my impudence, and
pretending to go out to bathe, shut the door after thern, and peeped through
a crevice, where they saw what was going forward3 for, not aware of the
trick, Ι got immediately to dinner: at first they could scarcely believe their
eyes, but presently fell a laughing, and brought several of their fellow-ser-
vants to view this speetac1e3 the noise and riot was at last so great that my
- master heard, and asked the meaning ofit3 when they told it him, he got
up from table, came to them, and looking in, beheld me devouring part of
a wild boar; he was highly diverted, and went in again ι thus was l expos-
ed to my master, both as a glutton and a thief: he laughed exeeffively at ir,
ordered me in to supper with him, and setting me down to the table, helped
me to flesh, oysters, broths, fifh, some in oil or pickle, others with mustard,
to every thing, in short, which other asses never eat. Perceiving that for-
tune seemed at length to smile upon me, and that this jest alone might pro-
cure me safety and happiness, though Iwas brim full, Ι still kept eating at
the table ε the whole company was in a roar, and at last one of them cried
out, this ass would drink wine too, if you would give it him; the master
immediately ordered them to get me some, and Ι supped it up.

The great man astonished, as you may suppose, at so singular and extra—
ordinary a creature, bad his steward give the servant, who had bought me,
twice as much as l eost him, and then gave me to the care of a young freed-
man, whom he ordered to teach me some such tricks as would be most
agreeable to him; all which I easily learned, and performed before him.
First, he taught me to fit down on the bed, like a man, and lean on my el-
bow, then to wrestle with him, to stand upright, to dance, to fignify Yes or
No by nods and gestures, with several other things, which Ι knew well enough
without teaching. The story was soon blazed abroad, of the ass that
wrestled, danced, and drank wine3 and above all, that could say Yes or No,

ᾗ Λυσιιβουιειῆ] There is something rather absurd and ridiculous in suppofing that Lucius,
when turned into an ass, should be fattened by the food which he was used to before his trans-
formation. But Lucian found it necessary, we may suppose, to break through the rules ofni*
ture and probability, that he might introduce the marvellous and truly laughable consequences
ol it.
