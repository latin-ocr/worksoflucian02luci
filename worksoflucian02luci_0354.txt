348 ENCOMIUMONAFLY.

like a mother preserving her sseeping infant, he has recourse to the fly for a
comparison, bestows on them the most beautiful epithets of frequent and full,
and calls their species ψ nations.

A fly is so strong, that with its bite it will pierce the skin, not only of a
man, but of an ox or a horse3 it will even creep between the wrinkles of the
elephants, and wound him as deep as a creature of that fize can.

In love it seems to enjoy peculiar happiness, flying with its mate in close
conjunctim, as we often see them, for many miles, and never separating
from each other. When the head of a fiy is cut off, the body will live a
long time and spin about.

But there is one extraordinary circumstance which I must take notice of,
and which Plato seems to have forgot in'his treatise on the Immortality of
the Soul ; if you 1 sprinkle ashes over a dead fly, it comes to life again; it
gains a new existence, so that it is plain, the soul of a fly must be immortal,
as after it has left the body, it returnS, and reanimates‚ and causes it to fly
about agaim which may reconcile us to the story 0f§ Hermotimus, whose
soul, they say, wandered about for a long time after it had quitted him, and
at last returned to his body, and restored him to life.

The fly alone, exempt from lab0ur‚ seems to enjoy the fruits ofothex’s
indussry‚ and to have a table always full; goats are milked for her, for her
the bee toils as well as for mankind, for her cooks dress their meat3 she
tastes it before kings themselves, walks from plate to plate, feasts on, and
evjoys every thing.

She doth not make her nest, or fix her habitation in any particular place,
but, like the Scythian, leads a wandering life, and wherever night overtakes
her, sets up her household gods, and makes her bed. ln darkness, as Ι
before observed, she does nothing, nor wishes she to do any thing in private,
any thing but what done in open day—light, ssie cannot be affiamed of.

ἦ Narium] Allnding to the former description of Homer’s εθνεα πολλα, which Pope calls the
&Vnimanum NATmNs.

ζ Ifyonsprinkli, ξὲικ] This, in reason and philosophy, is saying no more than that heat
will revive creatures apparently dead, and we very well know, that birds, inseiis, and animatis,
will continue morientess, and in a state of insensibility for a whole winter, till sun and summer
restore them to life and motion. But when Lucian said this, he did not expe& us to believe
him, and only meant a little laugh at old Plato.

ξ Hermotimus J See Pliny and Plutarch, who tells us many surprifing stories of this man and
several others, wonderfully restored to life.
