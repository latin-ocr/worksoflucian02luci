eye-witness of it. This man, says he, was sailing once from Italy to Athens,
about the setting of the Pleiades, with several paffengers on board the strip,
amongst whom was Euthydicus‚ and his friend Damon of Chalcis, the sor-
rner a stout, robust man, the latter weak and pale, beingjust recovered from

a violent illness : they had a prosperous voyage as far as Sicily, but just as
they were got into the Ionian sea, were overtaken by a most dreadful storm,
We will not dwell upon the whirlvvinds, showers of hail, high waves, and
other consequences of the tempest; suffice it here to observe, that when
they came near to Zacynthus, with their fail-yards all torn, and their ropcs
hauled out to stop the force of the current, Damon, who was fick with the
toffing of the vefl'el, had laid himself down with his body hanging over the
sea, and the strip leaning that way, a wave washed him headlong into the
ocean, and, which was worse, with all his clothes on, so that he could not
well swim : he kept himself up with some difficulty, for a time, and cried
out that he should be drowned. Euthydicus‚ who was naked in bed, heard
his eries, jumped out, and threw himself immediately into the sea, took
him up in his arms as he was just sinking, and swam with him towards the
ssiip. The rest of the paffengers would willingly have affisted the unhappy
sufferers; but the wind was so high, that they were not able : all they could
do was to throw out some pieces of cork, a few oars, and a large ship ladder.
And now, 1 heseech you, confidet for a moment, whether you can conceive
a nobler instance of friendship, than for a man thus, in the middle of the
night, to throw himself into a tempestuous sea, at the hazard of his life;
place before your eyes the desperate situation of them both, the dreadful
roar of the wave5‚ the darkness of the night, the soam dashing upon them,
one almost drowned, with his head scarce above water, stretching out his
hand to implore affistanee, the other leaping boldly in, and swimming to-
wards him, afraid that Damon should peristi before him: think of this,
and acknowlege with* me, that Euthydicus was no idle or unprofitable

friend.

Did they peristi, Mnefippus, or were they, beyond expe&ation, preserved?
Ι am in dreadful apprehensions for them.

You have no oecafion: for they were both saved, and are now philoso-
phers at Athens. Simylus only relates what he saw that night, that one fell
