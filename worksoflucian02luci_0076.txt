said he, with his Argonauts.’' A person aiking him, whether he thought the
soul was immortal, “ Yes, said he, it is immortal, but just as every thing
⁸ else is.” Concerning Herod, he remarked that Plato was right in saying
that men had more souls than one, otherwise Herod could never have εᾶεά
so ridiculoussy as to set † Regillas and Pollux up to supper with him, as if
they were alive; with other foolish actions of the same kind. He had the
contage once, to ask the Athenians at one of their public affemblies, “ Why
they excluded barbarians from their mysteries, when Eumolpus who institut-
ed them, was himself a barbarian of Thrace.'' When he was going to sea in
the winter, one of his friends said to him, ‘⁶ Are you not afraid of being
drowned and eat by the fisti ?” ‘⁶ It would be ingratitude in me, replied De-
monax‚ to murmur at being devoured by fifh, when 1 have, myself, devoured
so many ofthem.'’ He advised a certain rhetorician, who declaimed miser-
ably to exercise himself frequently for improvement; “ That l do, said he,
and always repeat it to myself :” “ No wonder you talk so wretchedly, replied
Demonax, when you praCtise before such a foolish audience.” Seeing a di—
vinet who prophecied for money, he said to him one day, “1 cannot see
what right you have to be paid thus for your prophecieS, if they can reverse
the decree of fate, take what you will, it must be too little ; but if all things
must happen as it is determined by God, of what use is your divination ?’'

An old Roman who took care to keep his body in exercise by {ham fights

‘⁵ N0b1y‚ indeed, against a wooden enemy.” Nobody was so elever as he,
at folving a difficult point: somebody asked him one day, in a scoffing
manner, this question, “ Pray, Demonax, ifyou burn a thousand pounds of
wood, how many pounds will there be of smoke?'' “ Weigh the ashes,
says he, and all the rest will be smoke.'' One Polybius, an illiterate fellow,
and who did not understand his own mother-tongue‚ acquainting Demonax,
that the emperor had honoured him with the freedom of Rome; “ Ι wi1h,

the Argonautis went after the golden fioece, so Apollonius the philosopher, and his scholars, fol-
lowed the emperor for what they could get, so that there is a double meaning in the application.

’θ Every thing εφη] Demonax, we see, with all his philosophy and virtue was a Maoerialist,

† Regillus and Polliam] His two sons who were dead. We have all heard of a parallel ab·
