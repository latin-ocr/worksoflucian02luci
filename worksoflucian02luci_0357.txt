ILLITERATE BOOK-HUNTER. 153

sented by the Muses with a braneh oflaurel : though, as for Helicon, where
these godesses refide, Ι believe you never so much as heard of it, nor, when
a boy, did you ever dwell the1·e; in such a one as you, even to mention 'their
names would be impiety3 they would not deign to appear before so dirty,
so uncouth a shepherd as thou art, with so much * sun upon thee. By ψ Li-
banitis, (for 1 rnust swear a vulgar oath when Iam talking with you,) I arn
sure the Muses would never comenear you, but instead of giving· you laur l,
would rather whip you with myrtle twigs, or leaves of mallen, 1⁴st thr-ir
2¹ Holmeus and Hippocrene, should be polluted by such unhallowed lips as
thine.

But, bold and impudent as you are, you can never dare to affert that you
area scholar, that you ever cultivated an intimacy with books, that such a
one was your master, or such a man your school-fellow: all that you can say
is, that you must be learned, because you, have got so many books: but,
suppose you have all the works of Demosthenes, with his Thucydides, eight
times transcribed in his own hand, suppose you have all that§ Sylla sent
from Athens into Italy, what additional learning can you acquire from
thence ? Suppose you lay thern under you, and sseep upon thern, or tye them
to your gown, and carry them about with you, what will you be the better
for it? A monkey, as the proverb says, is still a monkey, with all his
golden ornaments about him. You have, for ever, indeed, a book in your
hand, and are perpetually poring over ir, but, at the sanie time, you know
not what you read, and are like the ass ssiaking his ears at the lyre: if books
could make their master learned, how valuable would be the poffesfion of
them, the happy lot of you rich meu only l who thus might purchase wis·
dom, and so far excel us who are poor and needy! who in this case could
contend in eruditiori with the booksellers, who poffess and sell so many vo-
lumes? and yet, on examination, they will be found not much more learned
