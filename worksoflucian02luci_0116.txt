110 TOXARIS.

he had only a log on one hand, but at night, chains were put on every limb.
The stench of the prison, the heat from so many people stuffed close toge-]
ther, and scarce able to breathe, the noise of the feners, with the total want
of rest and ssecp, were altogether dreadful and intolerable‚ especially to a
man who had never experienced such calamities. He at length gave himself
up to despair, and refused to taste any food or nourishment. When Demetrius,
' hitherto a stranger to all this, returned ; the moment he heard of it, he ran to
the prison, but could not get admittance‚ fot it being then late in the even—
ing, the goaler, leaving other matters to the care of his servants, had locked
up the gate, and was gone to sseep. Early, however, in the morning, after
much intreaty, he was let in. He enquired for Antiphilus, who was so al.
tered by his missortunes that he could not be known, and ran about examin-
ing all the prisoners, like the friends of the ssain looking for their dead bo-
dies half-corrupted on the field of battle. At length, he called out
several times to him by name, and Antiphilus knowing the voice, and put-
tiizg afide the dishevelled hair that hung over his face, discovered himself.
The melancholy spectacle had such an effect, that they both fainted; and
when, in a little time after, they came to themselves, Demetrius, as soon
as he had heard the whole story of his missortunes‚ bade him be of good
ebear, took away the rags he had been clothed in, and wrapped him up in
part of his own cloak. From that time he constantly, whenever he could
find time and opportunity, attended on him. He even worked with the
merchants in the port, and carried burthens every morning, and with the
money he got by it, for he was well paid, provided for his friend, and,
xvithal, bribed the goaler to behave with kindness and civility to him. In
the day-time, he staid with, and comforted him, and at night made himself
a bed os leaves just on the outfide of the prison gate, where he always ssept.
In this manner they lived for some time, Demetrius having free access to
the prison, and Antiphilus bearing his missortunes more eafily, from the so-
ciety of his friend.

It happened some little time after that a robber died in prison, as it was
supposed by poison : a liric‘ter guard was immediately placed, and no stranger
admitted into the goal. Demetrius, in the utmost anxiety on this acf
count, went to the commanding officer, and accused himself of being con·
cerned in the robbery of ,the temple; upon which he was immediately sent
to prison, where he prevailed on the keeper, by many prayers and suppli·
