ENCOMIUM 0N DEMOSTHENES. 527

convey it to you. “ The fear of death and torture, said he, would have prc-
vented my coming into the presence of Antipater; but, if what you say be
true, lhav'e still more reason to dread, lest, if Antipater should spate my
life, Imight be corrupted, and, leaving the post of honour, which 1 held
in Greece, basely throw myself into Macedon : were Ι thus to aet, to what
purpose was the Piraeus, the walls and ditches which Ι built, the tribe of
Pandion, and the pomp of sacrifice; what profited the laws of Solon and
Draco, the military and naval decrees which Ι supported3 all the xima-s,
and all the trophies of my ancestors, the generosity of the citizens, who
crowned me, and all the powers of Greece, which l sustained and prel'trv—
ed? Ifl must owe my lise to the pity and to the liberality of others, Ι would
owe it, at least, to those whom I have obliged, to those captives whom Ι
have ruleemed, to those fathers whose children Ihave portioned, to those
whose debts Ι have paid : but if neither the influence nor authority which Ι
once possessed, both by sea and land, can secure me, to Neptune here I

cause fortune has deserted me, I will not, therefore, desert my country‘3
death is the best asylum we can fiee to from folly and corruption: Ι wiil
not disgrace Athens, by preferring ssavery to freedom. Do not you semem-

ber, for to you ,Ι may properly quote from tragedy, what † Polyxena says,

As she dy'd, with decency to fall
&Vas her peculiar care.

Thus fell a virgin, and shall Demosthenes prefer a shameful life to honourable
death, forgetful of what ζ Xenocrates and Plato have said concerning im—
mortality? But why need Ι repeat any more ?'' At length, after I had en-
deavoured, but >in vain, both by prayers and thr-ears, to prevail on him;
“ With these, said he, were Ι Archias, I might be moved ; but, being what
Ῑ am, you must pardon my not aC'ting like a coward.” Ι had then thoughts
of dragging him by force from the altar ; but, perceiving my intention, h:
