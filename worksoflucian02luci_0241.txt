But tell me, Pan, ate they grown better and more vitamus, from the

instrue-tion of these philosophers Ρ

What philosophers? those solemn, melancholy, talking follows, do you
mean, with down-cast eyes, and beards as long as mine?

Iknow nothing of them3 they are too wife to be understood by nie,
who am only a mountaineer, and never learned their fine polissied language.
who⁴ ever heard ofa Sophist or philosopher in Arcadia? A crooked reed and
a pipe is all my knowlege: Ι can feed goats, indeed, and dance, and fight
a little withal upon occafion. Ι have heard them talking sometimes about

strange unintelligible stuff: at first they are very calm and peaceable, but,
in the course of the dispute, frequently raise their voices into the ³¹⁵ Orthian
mode, <and in the heat of the battle, will exert themselves so violently that
their faces shall redden, their necks swell, and their veins rise like a flute-
player's when he blows in a narrow pipe: at length, the question entirely

tude, in the mean time, who have nothing else to do, gaze at them with
astonishment and admiration: for my own part, l always confidered them
as a set of vain empty fellows, and was not a little angry at their having
beatds so like my own. W'hether the public may reap any advantage from
their noise, or what good their eloquence may d0‚ I cannot say; but to spcak
the truth, as I live here in a little cave, hard by, Ι have seen them, some-
times, late in the evening

He is.

’Ἀ Ονώῐαη.] Το Ορθιον, say the lexkographers, sublati et intenti voce. Carmen Vero Orthi-
um dicitur quod voce subtiliffimzi cantatur ; the Orthian mode, says the Scholiast, is that, qui un
accendendos animos in praelio adhibehatur, which was made use of to rail'e the spirits of rnen ,η
