THE LI A R S. 321

“ Ion, interrupted Euerates, is not the only one who has seen spirits, both
by day and by night3 I have myself, indeed, a thousand times: at firstI was
frightened, but at length, by being used to them, find nothing extraordi-
nary in their appearance; especially fince an Arabian made me a present ofa
ring of iton, formed out of several ³¹⁶ croffes, and taught me a certain incanta-
tion, with a number of words in it; but, perhaps, you will not believe me.’'
’“ How is it poffible, replied 1, thatl should doubt the veracity of so wise a
man as Eucrates, speaking with freedom and authority, and in his own
house too ?’'
⁴ “ As to the statue, resumed he, who appears to every body, young and
old, Ι need not tell you myself, for it is known to all the family.'' “ What
statue, said Ι, do you mean ?'' ‘⁶ That beautiful one, replied he, which you
see as you come into the hall, made by Demetrius.'' “ The † Discobolus,
Isuppose, you mean, bending down as if going to throw the discus, and
looking back at the person that brought it him, with one knee bem, as if
prepared to rise after the cast.’' “ No, nO, that is Myro’s; I dt> not mean
that, nor the next to it, which is Polycletus’s‚ that has the head bound with
a fillet; pass over those on the right hand which represent the Tyrant-
Killers, done by Critias, and observe that which stands by the fountain,
with a large belly, bald-pated, half-naked, with the hain-s of his heard flut-
tering in the wind,'the muscles strong and bold, in short, the very ‡ man him-

it must not only be made qfsomething, but bysomething‚ and not only so, but after the like-
ness of something3 but, that after whose likeness it was made, what is it butan idea? whence
it followeth‚ that there are ideas.’'

Lucian frequently laughs at Plato and his followers‚ as obscure, mysterions, and unintellig-
ible: stom a view of the above explication of ideas, my readers will, probably, be οῖ’ the same

opinion. ‚

’χ’ Crcgffis] The iron, woncl, and probably everyrptirt of the inaterixls ofu³l1ich the cross, or
gassows, was made, for them'ecuiion of criminals, was, we may suppose, reckoned peculiarly
efficacious in the exorcifing of evil spirits by the superstitious heathens ot' that time. But super-
s stitions full as idle and ridiculons as any here tecotinted‚ have, we know, to our {haine be ir
spoken, many ages after, disgraced the enlightened :rra of Christianity. ”

εἰ· Βι]“ι“οόο[ω.] From ὃισκες famam, the thrower of the discum a sort of hen-ry round quoit
launched from a thong‚ put through a hole lundein the middle ofin it was thrown with a cir--
cular motion, one of the thrower's hands being near the breast, the other balant-ing the disi„
the limbs being all, as it were, in motion, the acritudo fine, and the inuscles properly emended.
must have formed, altogether, a good figure for the llatuary. The discobolus os Myro, pro-⁴
bably the same as is here taken notice of, is mentioned by Qintilian.
