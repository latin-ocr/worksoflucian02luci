208 THE COCK ΛΝΒ ‘rr-113 COBLER.

dinnerycstcrday? I am told, t00, that he brought an ear-ring for his wife
that eost five drachmas3 these wretches spend all my substance, to support
their luxury and extravagance. 1 wilh somebody does not undermine the
wall, and steal my money z there are a great many envious rogues that lay

wait for me, particularly my neighbour Micyllus,
M I C Y L L U S.

What! you think. Ι am like yourself, and have got one of your ³ pans un-

der my coat.
C O C K.

Softly, Micyllus, or, we shall be caught presently.
S 1 M O.

I had better not venture to go to sseep: Ι will get up and look all over the
house. Who's there ? aye, Ι see you digging under the wall; Ο, it is only
the pillar‚ all is fafe. Sray, I will count my gold over again, perhapsI
may have made a mistake. Hark! another noise; l arn befieged; there is
a conspiracy against me; where is my dagger? ifl catch thern -1 will e’en

bury mygold again. C O C K·

Yon see what a condition Simo is in ι but come, the night is not yet spent3
let us go to somebody else.

M I C Y L L U S.
Poor wretch 3 what a life does he lead ! thus may my worst of foes grow

rich ! let us give him a ssap on the face, and go off.

S Ι M O.
Who is that strikes me? thieves, thieves, I am ruined and undone.

M 1 C Y L L U S.
Aye, aye, warch and weep; fret till you look as yellow as the gold you
hang over. Νοκν, suppose we make a visit to Gnipho the usurer, he lives

but just by, see, the door is open.
C O C K.

Look, there he is, telling his ill-gotten riches upon his fingers, ssuivelled
up with care; soon must he leave all this, to become a gnat‚ a moth, or a fly⁸

M Ι C Y L L U S.
Isee the poor wretch 3 he lives a worse life now than either of them; his
calculations have worn him to nothing. Let us go somewhere else.

ὦ Panse] Alluding to Simo's havingstolen one of the Cobler's pans, as mentioned in the be-

ginning of this dialogue.
