And which, he tells us, was the most beautiful part of Vulcan’s thield.
The Phaeaeians, we may naturally suppose, were fond of dancing, beinga

one os thern says, ‘⁶ the city rnade such a man Proorchester: and another,
“ the people raised this to the memory of Ilati0n‚ for his well-danced

I shall not here observe, that amongst all the ancient mysteries, there are
none without dames, as Orpheus, Musaeus, and others, the best dancers of
