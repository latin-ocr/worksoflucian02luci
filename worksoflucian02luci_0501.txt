SYRIAN GODDESS.v

Yhis little Τνιιῖὶ contains a well-written and very entertaining Account ofseveralffl-
perstitious Rites and Ceremonies praflzstd in SYRm. As Lucum was himsclsan
AssYR1AN , what he says may be depended on. ,Many Particulars which he here
relates are extremely curious, and may at the firme Time be ufhfhl in elucidarJEff
several Polnts of Ancient Hg'story. The Traditjon concerning the DELUGE, mal
its Correspondence with the Mos Alc Accomzt, as related in the Nmrative, is very
remarkable. LUCIAn's Observation on the Customs αἰαῖ Manners of the People,
are fi'ffible andjudicious.

HERE is a city in Syria, not far from the river Euphrates, called

Hierapolis, or the sacred city, dedicated to Juno the Affyrian : when*
first founded it had probably some other name, and was only so called in lat-
ter ages, and after the great sacrifices which were there performed. Con-
cerning this city and the contents of it 1 propose to speak largely, and oftheir
customs, feasts, and sacrifices. I ihall likewise mention what is reported
concerning its founders, an'd after what manner the temple is built. A I arn
myself an Assyrian, I {hall relate partly what Ι was an eye-witness of, and
partly what happened in former times, which 1 had from the priests who
refide there.

The AEgyptianS, according to tradition, were the first rnen who had any
teligious worship, built temples, raised altars, or instituted rites and cere-
monies; they had the first knowlege ofsacred things, and were the first pre-
servers of sacred history. The Affyrians, some time after, imbibed their
donftrines, and built oemples, in which they placed also statues, and idols,
of which the AEgyptians had none in former ages: there are at present tern-
ples in Syria, almost as ancient as the AEgyptian, many of which Ihave
seen ; amongstwhich is that of ³⁶ Hercules the Tyrian, much older than the
Grecian Hercules. There is likewise another temple in Phoenicia, amongst

->‹= Hc›·s:1‹.⁷<·s.] Hercules, as the learned Bryant observes, (see his Analyfis of Ancient Mytho-
10gy‚ vol. 11. p. 75.) was a title given to the chief deity of the Gentiles, who has been multi-
plied into almost as many personages as there were countries where he was worshipped. Tully,
111 his Natura Deorum, mentions, 1 think, fix of this name3 Qartus‚ says he, Jovis est δε
Astriae, Latonae sororis, quem Tyrii colunt. Which is the Hercules here alluded to.
