TmFALsEPRoPHET. 15

But I must tell you some of the oracles which he delivered to Rutilianus.
This wisc senator, asking him one day, whom he should appoint for a tutor to
his son by a former wife, who was now arrived at an age fit for instruction3

his answer was,
Pythagoras, and the war-describing bard-

The boy unfortunately dying a few days after, he was sadly at a loss how to
excuse the oracle‚ which this event so flatly contradicted3 but Rutiliamls,
like agood creature, took the defence upon himself, and averred that the
god had prophefied the vcry thing which happened, by thus recommending
t'o him no living preceptor, but Homer and Pythagoras, who were dead, and
with whom the boy probably now was in the ffiades below. Now th my
friend, can blame Alexander, when he had to do with such wiseacres as

these?
Another time he asked him what body he had formerly appeared in, to

which the oracle thus replied,

First thou Achilles wert, and next Menander,
Now Rutilianus‚—thou {halt live on earth Ἣ
One hundred fourscore years, and after shine
A sun-bearn in the heav’ns

He died, notwithstanding, at seven-ty years of age, of a bilious colic, with-

out waiting for the completion of the oracle.·
1 will tell you another of his vocal answers, The same Rutilianus asking

him one day whom he should marry, he replied in plain termS,

Wed thou a woman sprung from Alexander,
And from the Moon

for hc had spread a report, it seems, that he had a daughter by the Moon,
who had fallen in love with him, as it is her ³4² custom to do with pretty
fellows, in his sseep: the prudent old man made no delay, but immediately
{ent for her, and commenced a bridegroom at threescore‚ having first propi-
tiated his mother-in-law, the Moon, with whole hecatombs‚ expecting, no
doubt, that he should soon be himself ranked amongst the deities.

 

 

When he had once got footing in Italy he became more bold and confi-
dent, sending forth his oracles throughout the whole Roman empire, fore*-
