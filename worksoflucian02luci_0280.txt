274 THEPARASITE.

committed by thern in our own age, but have them recorded in books;
there is still extant the apology of SocratCS‚ AEscffines, Hyperides, Demos-

thenes, and many others amongst your wise rnen ; but who ever saw the de-
sence of a parafite? nor can we call to mind a suit commenced against one

ofthem. ’

But, suppofing the life of a parafite superior to that of an orator 01· philo-
sopher, his death, after all, perhaps, may be much more wretched.

S I M O.
So far from it„ that it is infinitely more happy. All your philosophers, we

know, at least three parts of them, have died miserably3 some condemned
to suffer for the most atrocious of crimes, have been forced to drink ³* poison,
others were burned to ashes, others died of the strangury, and others were
banished3 whereas parafites ¹never go off in either of these ways, but corne
to a happy end, eating and drinking3 or if, perhaps, any of thern ever did
die a violent death, it must have been from indigestion-

You have fought your parafite’s battle with the philosophers most nobly;
all Ι want you now to shew, is, what honour and profit redounds to the pa·
tron who supports him, and whether it is not a ssiame he should be so liberal-

ly supported. S I Ἦ O

How ignorant, TychiadeS, must you be, not to know that the rich man)
who ears by himself, though he had all the wealrh of Gyges, must be really
poor, and if he appears in public without a parasite, look's like a beggar!
sor, as a soldier is contemptihle without arms, a garment without purple,
or a horse without his trappings‚ even so does a great man without a parasite
seem of no rank or estimation. The parasite sets off the rich man, but the
rich man never sets off the pai-alite: it is no disgrace, as you acknowlege, for
the latter to {ive upon the former, as the poor should depend upon the rich3
and to the former-the dependent is highly useful, not only because he shews
him off, but because from the attendance of the one, is derived the happi-
ness of the other: wne beto those who attack the patron, when his parafite
stands by him3 aud who will attempt to poison the man who has always a
friend to taste his meat and drink for hin] ἒ the rich man is not only digni-
