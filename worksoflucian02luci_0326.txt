‘⁵ ‚lf you had scen all this, T'ychiades, you would not, 1 think, have called
in question the power of incantations.'' “ You are right, said Ι, ifl had seen
I-ihould certainly have believed; but you will pardon me, I hope, ifI am
not altogether so quick-fighted as you arc. I know the lady whom you speak
of extremely well, a very lox-ing one she is, and with no great difficulty to
be acquired, nor can I see any necessity of sending your little clay ambassa-
’ dor to her, or the M00n‚ or the Northern Magician; assor twenty drachmas
ssie would go to the Hyperboreans themselves ; this is an incarnation which
ssie always listens to: though her nature is a little different from that ofappari-
tions, for they, as you tell us, fly away at the found of brass or iron, where-
as, if she hears the least tinkling of fili-er, {he will run to you immediately.
But l am most surprised, that this great magician himself, who might, no
doubt, be loved by the wealthiest of the sex, and be paid with many a good

‘⁶ It is ridiculous in you, said Ion, thus to disbelieve every thing; but

moon-light, rolling their eyes about, and foaming at the mouth, and for a
certain small reward, raised them up, and sent them home quite recovered.
I-Ie would stand over the evil spirits, and ask them whence they carne, the
patient, :ill the time, says nothing, and the spirit answers in Greek, or some
other language, and tells him hoW‚ and from whence he came into the man3
rhen, by coniurations, or, if that will not do, by threats‚ he drives the
ex il spirit out of him: l have seen it myself, and itlooked black and smoaky.”
‘¹ I arn not at all surprised, replied I, at your seeing such things, for even
your father Plato’s ’θ ideas are visibly seen by you, though so much thinner ·

substances, and to us, common mortals, absolutely invifible.'’

there are ideam ror, if 'matter irselr‘, be in itself void of measure, it is necessary that it receive
measure from some superior, that is wholly remote from matter: but the antecedentis true,
