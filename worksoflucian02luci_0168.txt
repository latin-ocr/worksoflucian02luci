do, if one os the golden ones that weighs several talents, should be but in·
differently worked, of the commonest sort, and not answering in the other
respectu must I place him before the brazen ones of Myro, and Polycletes‚
or the stone of Phidias and Alcamenes; or do you think, that those who

It should be so ; but we must put the golden one first.
