the outfide of the wall, as if somebody was breaking in ; and so it proved,
sor in a short time there was a great gap in it, big enough for a man to enter
at: somebody soon came in, and another followed him, and then several
more, all armed with swords. They had bound Hipparchus, Palaestra, and
my servant, in their beds‚ ransacked the whole house, and were now carry-
ing off the money, cloaths‚ and furniture. When they had got it all to·
gether, they took me, the other asS, and the horse, and purting on our
pack-saddles‚ placed the baggage on our backs: with this heavy burthen
they drove us on, beating us with sticks through the mountains and by-
paths, that they might not be discovered. What became of the other beasts
Ι know not, but for myself, having no shoes on, and not used to travel over
sharp-pointed rocks, and with such a weight‚ I was half-dead: often did Γ
stumble, though not suffered to fall, as there was somebody always behind
me, with a good stick to keep me up. Ι tried often to cry out, “ O master‚'⁷
but could only bray: the O, indeed, came out, and made noise enough ;⁷
but Master would not follow : even sor this Ι was handsomely cudgelled, for
fear my braying should discover them: perceiving, therefore, that I could
not cry out as Iought, 1 determined to jog on in filence, and save my car—
case.

It was now day-light, and we had paffed over several mountains: they
had tied the bridle‚ however, over our mouths, that we might not lose our
time in feeding as we went along3 an ass, therefore, I was obliged still to
remain. About the middle of the day we were turned into a stable, belong-
ing to some of their brethren‚ such at least, by their behaviour, we ima-
gined them to be, for they saluted them, invited them to dinner, and or-
dered us some barley: the rest of us fell to, but as Ι had never been
used to raw barley, though Ι was almost famished, Ι could not taste it,
but looked about me for something else, when, behind the stable‚ l spyed
out a gaulon, with a good many fine herbs in it, and above them‚.something
which Ι took sor roses: immediately, unobserved by the men who were ern·
ployed within at dinner, 1 got into the garden, partly to fill my belly with
the raw herbs, and partly for the sake of the roses, which Ithought, ifI
could lay hold on, 1 might have a chance of being a man again. 1 fell up-
on the lettuces, radishes, and parssey, and feasted as long as Ι, could stuff;
but as for the roses, they proved not to be real ones, but what they call the

ἕ laurei-rose : woe be to the horse or assthat feeds on such, for if they taste
