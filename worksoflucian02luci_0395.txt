ENCOMIUM ONAHOUSE. 389

colours, with the truth, accur-acy, and judgment conspicuous throughout,
might, perhaps, be properly compared to the first appearance of the spring,
or a mead diverfified with flowers, were it not that these soon fade and decay,
whilst this house is a perpetual spring, an everlasting flower that never
fades or decays; the fight alone rests on its sweets‚ but cannot defile or de-
stroy them.

Who can help dwelling on such beauties with raptum, and endeavouring to
celebrate them as they d'eserve? for, that which we see, it is a disgrace not to
imitate; the fight of what is truly excellent, brings with it a thousand in·
citements to the praefice of equal perfcstion, not in man alone, but in every
creature. The horse bounds with more pleasure over the soft plain, that
yields to his foot, nor refists his preffing hoof; then does he put forth all
his strength, runs swiftly on, and vies, as it were, with the earth he treads
on, in beauty and perfectiori. In the early part of spring, when the mea-
dows are green, and the flowers appear in their brightest colours; the pea-
cock spreads his wings to the sun, bristles up his tait, displays his flowers
also, and seems to rival the field in beauty3 he struts round and round, ad-
miring his own splendour, whilst the light changes the colours, and breaks
them into various tints that blend with, and succeed each other,· above all,
in those beautiful circles which rise at the extremity of his body, and repre-
sent the rainbow in every one of thern: the least change of situation turns

the brass into gold, or gives the purple, when shaded from the sun, a green-
ish hue; as the light varies, the feathers are varied also. How doth the sea,

when itis stnooth and calm, attra& and invite us Ε he who has never been
from land, and knows nothing of sailing‚ wishes to geron board', to quit the
shore, and launch into the ocean3 especially if he sees the sails filled by pro-
pitious gales, and the vessel, with a sofr and easy motion, gliding throughv
the waves.

Thus, also, must the beauty ofthis house animate and inspire every orator
who would wish to celebrate and describe it: for that purpose came I hither,
attrac‘ted, as it·were, by a Syren’s voice, and flatrering myself, that, how-
ever rude rny speech harh hitherto been on such a subje&‚ it will appear ex-
cellent3 thus cloathed, it must be handsome.

But 1 am interrupted and contradiCted, it seems, by another orator, a

powerful one too, who says, Iam wrong in afferting that the beauty of the

house, adorned like this, with gold and pietures, must inspire the speaker
