APOPHRAS. 381-

also a're no strangers to your charae'ter: but know you full as well z nor see Ι
any reason why Alexandria should yield to Antioch in this respec‘t3 your
debauchery, indeed, was there still rnore open, your behaviour mom infa-
mous, and bare-faced. One person, and one only, beliexetl yon innocent,
took your word for it, and supported you, a Roman of the first distinetionr
Ῑ need not mention his name,⁴ asevery body knows whom Ι mean, nor what
he suffered from his-conneffion with γους when he found you in a certain
situation with a certain persom what think you was his opinion ; did he be-
lieve you to be innocent when he caught you in the very fuet? he could not,
unless he had‘been blind; but he· shewed what he thought of you, by turn³
ing you out of· doorS, and when* youwere gone out of his house, they say,
took care to have it purified after such pollution.

Achaia and all Italy is full of your noble deeds, and the renown‘you have
acquired by them: may you reap the fruits of it! Ι can only say, which is
most indisputable‚ that those who now wonder at what you do in Ephesus,
will wonder no longer, when they hear what you have done before: with re-
gard to women, I find you have learned something new.

And does not such a-manadeserve the name of Apophras ?v But what can·
you mean, afterall your iniquities, by offering to salute us, especially those
who know you, and w'no have had enough from your mouth already, your*
rough voice, barbarous phrases, every thing, in short, that is dissonant, un-
couth‚ and inharmonious3 but from a kiss, above all, heaven defend us!
rather would Ι· have one from a viper or a scorpi0n3 from thern we might
expe& a bite or pain, which, perham, a phyfician could remove; but from·
· the poison of thy kiffes, what altar, or what temple should ever save us?
After such infection, what god would listen to our prayers? How many
’ sprinklings‚ and ablutions‚ how many rivers would be necessary to wassx
away the stain?

How can such a fellow as you pretend‘to laugh arthelanguage of others?
For my own part, so far from denying that Ι rnade use of the word Apo—
phras, Ι should be assmmed of not being intimately acquainted with it3 but
when you tall< of '³' syllable-measurers, and word-crackers, of people that
are trifling-manner’d‚ when, instead of saying you want to go to Athens,
you tell us that you Athenize, that such a man is flower·crowned, and the

*θ Syllable-measurers, &c.] The epithets and expressions here alluded to, are probably· those
which Timarchus made use of in the speech above hinted at, as mentioned by Elenchns.
