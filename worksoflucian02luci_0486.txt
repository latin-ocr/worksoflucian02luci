And therefore it was, that Charinus himself defired us, if we wanted to

‘know the truth, and every thing that passed, to apply to you, as you knew
all the circumstances exe-&lm and attended carefully to what was said and
done ι you will not, therefore, 1 am sure, refuse to give us this treat, which,
to me, will be a most agreeable one 3 especially as welcan enjoy the banquet
here, with ali sobriety‚ and out of the resch of danger, or blood-ihed, whe-
ther the old men get drunk, and disturb the company, or the young men
grow warm, and are troublesome and impertinent.

You should not press me, Philo, to publish things that happen at a drink-

ing bont, which, perhaps had better be buried in oblivion. It was all the
work of Bacchus, who, we may suppose, despises allthose who are not ini-
tiated into his sacred rites‚ and will not celebrate his orgies ς it is unlawsul,
therefore, to enquire too nicely into those mysteries, from which the pro-
phane should depart in filence3 befides, as the poet sayS,

You are mighty delicate3 but, in good truth, friend Lycinus, you ssmuld
not pretend thus to impose upon me, who very well know that you are more
willing to tell than Ι am to hear it; and that, if you could find nobody to
listen to you, you would declare it open-mouthed‚ frorn beginning to end,
to the first statue that you met with. 1f Ι was to go away without hearing,
I know you would run after, stop, and intreat me. Iwill be as nice and
delicate as you, and take myself away: I can asse somebody else, so you

need not trouble yourself.

Good Philo, do not be angry3 fince you are so very defirous, I will e'en

tell you, but you must not mention it to every body.
