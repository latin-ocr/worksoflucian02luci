pire, do you think I should, myself‚ have been such a fool as to give them
both up, and live retired under the dominion of another? but, as Ι well
knew the consequence of being rich and great, 1 refigned, and well it was
for rne, all thoughts of it.

With regard to the complaint you make, of their revelling in wild boars

and fine cakes, whilst you, even on feast days, are glad to feed on creffes,
leeks, and onions; the case is fairly thus ε at the time when they are caten,

both are equally sweet‚ and, perhaps, equally innocent, but in their eonse-
quences extremely different3 for, you do not, like thern, rise the next day
with the head-ach, or breathe forth the nauseous stench os a sour stomach
from repleti0n3 add to this, that they are incited by lust and luxury to
spend their nights in riot and debauchery, and thence contra& severs,
dropsieS, inflarnmations of the lungs‚ and a thousand other disorders. Shew
me one of them who does not look pale and livid, like a carcase; if they ar-
rive at old age, are not three parts ofthem deprived of the use of their legs,
and carried about by their servants ? They have a golden appearance with·
out, but within, are patched up, like player’s garments, with the poorest
rags and tatters. fifh, you never taste, neither are you troubled, like those
who do, with gouts and palfies. Add to this, that eating perpetually of
these things, and more than enough, it gives them very little pleasure, and
you often see them as fond of herbs and ominus, as you can be of hares and
⁸ wild boare.. I shall pass over a thousand other missortunes which they are
liable to, such as profligate children, wives that fall in love with their ser-
vants, and women that yield.to them more from neceffity than affection.
There are many others which you know nothing of, whilst you only look
upon their gold and purple3 and when you see them drawn in pomp by their
white horses, you gape at, and admire thern. But if you would neglect and
despise thern, if you would not stare at their filver ehariots, look at the rich
jewels on their rings, or gaze upon their fine cloath53 if you would let thern
alone to enjoy their riehes by themselves, they would then come of their own
accord, and invite you to sup with them, merely that they might shew you
their cups, their beds, tables, and all their treasures, which are of no service
to them, unless they are seen and admired3 and it is for your sake alone,
that they value themselves on the poffeffion of them.
This, my good friends, 1 have written for your comfort and satisfactiom
l have experienced both conditions, and {hall only add, that I hope you
will
