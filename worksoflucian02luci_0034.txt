23 OHDANCING.

L Y C 1 N U S.
Blcss us, Crato, what a fierce dog have you let loose upon me! but your

fimile, iet me tell you, of the Syrens and Lotophagi, is by, no means appi-
cable to my case: for those who eat the lotus, and listened to the Syrens,
were punished with death; whereas, with regard to myself, befides that
the pieasure is much greater than theirs, the consequence also is good and
happy3 for neither have I by this forgot my private concerns, nor become
incapable of doing my bufiness; but, on the contrary, 1 can affirm, always
return from the theatre more alert‚ and fit for all the offices of life, so that
I may say with Homer, who was an eye witness of it,

ἲ* Delighted 1 return, and wiser far.

But pray tell rne, Crato, do you find fault with dancing‚ and the stage,
after being often present at them; or, having never been there, do you, not-
withstanding, affert that they are indefenfible ? If you have seen thern yourself,
you are upon the level with me3 and if you have nor, surely your accusa-
tion is unreasonable and ill-founded, when you condemn that which you

know nothing of.

Most certain it is, Ihave never been there: it would but ill become me,
with my long beard and grey locks, to fit myself down amongst a heap of
women, and mad spectators, to applaud a worthless fessow, writhing his body
into a thousand forms, for no good or useful purpose whatsoever.

LYCINUS.

Ι must pardon you, Crat0‚ since this is the case3 but if you will take my
advice, only go by way of experiment‚ and open your eyes3 I will answer·
for it, you will soon be for going early, and before any body else, to secure
a good place, from whence you may see and hear every thing distinetly.

CRATO.

May I perish if ever} submit to any such thing whilst I have hair on my

legs, and my beard is not pulled off! In the mean time 1 fincerely pity you,
who are seized with this Bacchanalian frenzy.

²* Delaghtcd] This is a literal transsation of the line in Homer, which is

ththzpaetvog νειται, και πλειονοι ειέως,

which is part of the Syren's song in the twelfth book of the Odyss'ey. Pope has sunk the
whole line in his transsation, and, as he frequently does, gives us something else in the room
of it.
