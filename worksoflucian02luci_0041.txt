Hefiod also, who was not told of it by others, but himself,
*At early morn beheld the dancing choir,

in the beginning of his poem, fings the Muses Praise, and tells us, as the
highest encomium of thern, that

’ἓ On the clear fountain’s brim, with render feet,
They lead the mazy clance, around the altar
Of their celestial fire

And is it not, my friend, almost to fight against the gods, thus to revile so
noble an art?

Socrates, who, if we are to credit the Pythian oracle, was the wisest of
men, not only praised dancing, but did himself condescend to learn it, attri-
buting the greatest effe& to mufic, numbers, and modulated motions; nor
, was he ashamed, though an old man, to confider it as the most serious thing.
He was, indeed, no little friend to it who frequented the schoois of music,
and listened even to the† courtezan Aspasia for wisdom and instruction,

 

though he lived when the art was in its infancy, and long before it had ar-
rived at its present perfefti0n3 had he seen those who now prastise it, he
would, 1 doubt not, have left every thing else for this entertainment alone,
nor have taught his pupils any thing before, or in preference to it.

When you talked oftragedy and comedy, you must certainly have forgot ’
that there are dances appropriated to each of them; for one, the Emmeleia;
for the other the Cordax3 the Sicynnis also is sometimes taken in with them3
but fince you set out by preferring these to dancing, because they are fre-
quently proposed as subjects of contention, and are therefore honourable.
let us compare them together, to pass over mufic, which is only an attenti*
ant on our art, and subservient to it.

If we are to judge of tragedy from its first appearance, what a disgusting
and formidable spectacle it is ! to see a man come in stretched our to an en-
ormous length, and stalkingin high-beeled fimes, with a maik that comes
out beyond his head, and gapes as if it would devour all the ss)e&atorS‚ not
to mention the cushions stuck out on the breast and belly to make artificia!
