166 ’ JUPITER THE TRA'GEnlAN.

was burned out immediately, and gave so little smoke‚ that we could hardly ’
smell it·, though, when his ship got on the shallows, and struck upon the
rock, he promised us whole hecatombs, if we would deliver him.

Whilst I was pondering on these things, I carne towards the Poecile, where
I saw a vast crowd of people aslembled‚ some within the porch, others in the
open air, and, amongst the rest, two who were seated, and seemed very
loud and vehement in their discourse : finding these to be, as Idid imagine,
two philosophers in a warin debatc, 1 was resolved to hear what they said ς
and, being concealed in a thick cloud, I immediately affumed their habit
and appearance, and by the help os a long beard, might easily have
passed for a philosopher. I elbowed through the crowd, and got in, nobody
knowing who I was. There 1 found that rascal Damis the Epicurean, with
my good friend Timocles the Smic, in high dispute. Timocles had argued
himself into a sweat‚ and almost cracked his voice with roaring; whilst Damis
continued to provoke him with his Sardonic sneers.

Their whole debate was concerning us: the villain Darnis denied that we
took any care of mortals, or looked into‘their affairs; affirmed, in short, that
there were no gods at all, for that was plainly what he aimed at, and many
who were present agreed entirely with him. Timocles, on the other hand,
who was of our fide of the question, defended us with all his might, and
shewed with what beautiful order and regularity we ruled and diree'oed every
thing. He also met with the praise and approbation of some, but he was
now grown tired, and spoke but indifferently, so that the multitude leaned
towards Darnis. Perceiving the danger we were in, Ι commanded night to
surround them, and put an end to the dispute. The‘y parted, therefore,
having first agreed to renew the debate next day. Ifollowed the croud, and
overheard their sentiments as they returned horne, which were mostly in fa·
vom· os Damis, who, Ι found, had got the majority on his fide: some, in-
deed, were not for predetermining the cause, but resolved to wait till they
heard what Timocles had to say at their next meeting.

This, my brethren, is the bufiness for which I called you together; mat.
τετε, you see, of no little consequence and importance: as on men, all our
honour, glory, and worship must depend. If ,they are once persuaded
that there are no gods, or isthere are, that we take no care of human affairs,
we shall have no more gifts, or vidtims fromthern, but may fit and starve in
heaven, without festivals, holy--days, watchings, sacrifices, or any pomp oi·
ceremony whatsoever. These, I say, are things of moment, and it will be-
