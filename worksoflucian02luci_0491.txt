servants, who stood behind, laughed immoderately3 the grammarian, who

sat next to him, patched together a parcel of verses from Pindar, H‘efiod,
and Anacreon, and made a ridiculous jumble of them all; amongst the rest,

as if he had been a prophet, he repeated,

ᾗ Now ssiield with ffiield, with helmet helmet clos’d,
To armour armour, lance to lance oppos’d,
ViCtors and vanquish'djoin promiscuous eries,

And {brilling shoutS, and dying groans arise-

Whilst Zenothemis read a manuscript in the smallest charafterQ which he
had taken from one of the waiters.

ι In the interval between the courses‚ Aristaenetus, that no part of the time
might be without some entertainmem, had taken care to provide a buffoon,
who was brought to say or do any thing comical or ridiculous that could di-
