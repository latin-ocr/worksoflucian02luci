423 THEWISHES.

the weeping monarch, without paying the least respe& to his diadem. Thus
cast down from your envied height, and dethroned, you tread the same
path with the lowest ssave, and all you leave behind is a magnificent tomb, a
proud column, or a lofty pyramid, the last poor triumph of vain man, who
cannot enjoy it. Those statues and temples which are raised, the mighty
name which is acquired, mouldcr away quickly, and are no more; or, if
they remain ever so long, what profit is it to those who can no longer bc
senfible of then] Ρ You see, my friend, what toils, anxiety, and solicitude you
would go through whilst living, and what you would have to expe& after death.

And now, Timolaus, it is your turn to form a wish, superior, I hope, to
their’s, and such a one as may be expected from a prudent and senfible man

likeyou.

Observe then, LycinuS, and take notice, whether I wilh for any thing un-
reasonable, or that can merit censure. Money, treasures‚ kingdoms, wass,
and empires, which you have so deservedly condemned, laffure you, I shall

in them. .

1 wilh Mercury would make me a present of a few rings endowed with se-
veral virtues, one of them should make me always in perfec‘t health, invul-
nerable, and liable to no distempers3 another with the power of rendering
me invisible, like that of ³⁶ Gyges: another should make me as strong as
ten thousand men, who should not be able to lift what I could carry with
ease3 by another, Ι would be able to raise myself above the earth, and fly
where 1 pleased3 by another, I would set every body to sseep when Ι thought
proper, and every door should be open to me, every lock loosened, and
every bolt drawn back wherever I came3 by virtue of another, and that the

most valuable of all, 1 would become, as soon as 1 put it on, the most ami-
able and desirable of all mankind, insomuch, that every body should be in

love with me3 the women should all go mad for me, and happy should she
be, whom I would deign to look upon, whilst those whomI ssighted should
hang themselves, or die for grief ; in short, I would be more beautiful than
Hyacinthus, Hylus, or Phaon.

²* Gygen] A simple strepherd of Lydia, who, by means ofa ring which rendered'him invi·
