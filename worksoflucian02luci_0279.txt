THEPARASITE. 273

ment produces nothing harih nor gloomy‚ but rather excites mirth and
laughter3 he puts those in a good humour with whom hc converses, and is,
himself, never melancholy, as it is the peculiar advantage of his profession,
that nothing can make him uneasy; for he has neither estate, nor house, nor
servant, nor wife, nor children, the loss of which, and they are all perifhablc,
must deeply affe& the poss'efl'or of themu but he is not fond of glory, or
riches, or any of those things that are so univesally admired.

T Y C H I A D E S.
But, perhapS, Simo, want of victuals may now and then affe& him a

little.
s 1 M ο.

You have forgot, my friend, that he who wants victuals is no parafite;
he is not a brave man whose bravery is departcd from him, nor is he a wisc
man who is deprived of wisdom ; our inquiry is about him who is a parasite,
and not about him who is none; now if the brave man is only brave whilst
-he is exercifing his bravery, and the prudent mari whilst heis praetifing pru-
dence, in like manner, he only is a parasite who is ⁴< actually feeding‚ and if
he is not s0, we are talking not about him, but about somebody else.

The parafite then, you think, must always have plenty.

Certainly3 neither on this account, therefore, nor any other, can he be
unhappy. Moreover, you will please to observe‚ that orators and philoso-
phers are all cowards; you never see them go out without a elul), which
⁵ they would not be armed with, if they were not afraid ; making their doors
as fast as poffible for sear of thieves ι whilst our parafite just shuts his, and
that carelessly, to keep the wind out3 be there ever so much noise in the
night, he is no more moved than ifthere was no noise at 2113 and if he walks
through a desart, he goes without asword, for he is afraid of nothing: but
many a philosopher have I seen, armed with spears and arrows, where there
is nothing to fear; they carry clubs with thern even when they go into the
bath, or to dinner: you never knew a parasite accused of an amalr, rape,
adultery, or any crime ofthat kind; he never hurts any body but himself:
but as to orators and philosophers, we not only know ofa thousand crimes
