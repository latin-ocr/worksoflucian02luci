514 ENCOMIUM on DEMOSTHENESa

THERSAGORAS.
I osten entertain myself in comparing one with the other3 and particularly

Homer and Demosthenes, who so much resemble each other in strength,
spirit, and that divine inspiration common to both: his

Oppress’d with wine, of Homer,
with Philip's ’ᾖ drunkenness, dancing and lasciviousness. The

‡ VVithout a fign his sword the brave man draws,

of the one, with “ It ᾗ becomes good men, supported by good hopes, &cl'
And when I read,

Η KVhat tears shall down thy filver beard be roll’d,
O Peleus, old in arms, in wisdorn old.

It must put me in mind of, “ 4 What groans did those brave men send
forth, who died for glory and for freedoxn!'' 1 compare the “ flowing
qs Python‚’' to the words of Ulysses, that were

Ἠ- Soft as the fleeces of descending snows,
And that of Homer,

ῃ Cou’d all our care elude the gloomy grave,

with a fimilar passage of Demosthenes, where he says, “ ἓξ For death
must be the end of every man, even if he hides himself in the most secret
cave :⁷⁹ and a hundred other places, where the thoughts of both are nearly
the same. I admire their. figures, their allegorieS, their tranfitions‚ their
sweetness‚ their pathos, their hatred, in short, of every thing that is barbar-
ous and inelegnnt. To say the truth, I must confess, that Demosthenes has
reproved the indolence of the Atheniens with more force and spirit than Ho.
