Be hush’d, ye winds, and heav'n serene;
For, 10! the ’³‘ bed-admiring queen
Approaches! on her crutches, see,
She comes3 hail, pow'rful deity!
Accept the pray'rs of thy devoted nain,
Smne, goddess kind, and mitigate our pain.

Emer GODDESS GOUT.

What mortal knows not me? unconquer’d Govr,
Great queen of pain, whom not the reeking blood
Of many a vffitim on the altars ssain,

Nor richest incense, nor the votive gifts,

O'er the proud temples hung, can e’er assuage,
Nor mighty Paean‘s self, with all his herbs
Medicinal, nor Phoebus’s skilful son,

Great AEsculapius‚ can subdue: since man
&Vas first created, hath he rastily strove,

But strove in vain, with ev’ry fruitless art

To check my conquests, and elude rny pow’r.

Whilst sorne their plantam, and their smallage bring,
Lettuce, or purssane, hore-bound, nettles sharp‚
Fen-gather'd lentiles, or the Persian weed,

Leeks, scallions, poppies, hen-bane, or the rind
Of ripe ponigranate, frankineense, and flea-wort,
The root of potent hellebooe, or nitre3

some steep‘d in wine, the husks of beans prescribe‚
Or spawn of frogS, a sov’reign cataplasm,

Carrot, or *3* pimpernel, or barley flour,

Or gall of cypress tree, the healing dung

Of mountain-goat, or still more fetid man,

† Pimpernel.] Gr.1<07„72auoazev‚ which Ican make nothing of, there being, as my learned
friend Sir George Baker observed to me, no such Greek word ; he was, therefore, of opinion,

that the true reading here, must be nomem, and the rather, ns he judicioussy remarked to me,
because Paullus has a medicine for the gout, which he calls ὣακολλαςιε.
