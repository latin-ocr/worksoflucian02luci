fhutting vits mouth by means of a horse hair, which likewise moved about a
black forked tongue. This Pellaean serpent they had by them for some time
ready to be produced on the first proper occasion, to carry on the farce, or

rather to be the principal attor in it.
As the lhew was now to begin, he hit on the following project. He went

b'y night to the foundations of the temple, which had been lately (lug up,
and which were full of water, either from the adjacent places, or by the
rains, and there lodged a goose's egg that had been made hollow, and filled
up with a young serpent: after sticking this in the mud, he returned home;
and the next day appeared naked in the market—place, with only a girdle of
gold round his middle, and ssiaking his dissievelled locks, like the worship-
pers of Cybele, ayvith his scythe in his hand, and getting upon a high altar,
harangued the populace, congratulating them on the near approach of the
divinity which was soon to appear amongst thern. The multitude, for al-
most all the city was got together, old men, women, and children, were
astonished, and began to pray to and worship him. He muttered some-
thing obscure and unintelligible, like the Hebrews and Phoenicians, and
struck them wonderfully, though they could make nothing of it, only that
he talked about Apollo and AEsculapius. He then ran to the temple, and get-
ting into the ditch that had been dug, and near the fountain of the oraele
which he had prepared3 he stood in the water, and with a loud voice sung
hymns to Apollo and AEsculapius, invoking thegod to come with happy omens
into the city. He then asked for a cup, which being given him, he enfily
placed it under, and brought up, together with water and muti, the egg in
which he had hid his divinity: the aperture being artfully closed up with
wax and white lead3 and then taking it into his hand, he crit-d out that he
had got AEsculapius. The people, after expreffing their astonissiment at see-
ing an egg found in the water, kept their eyes fixed on him to marl< what

would follow, when, breaking the egg, he received the young serpent into
the hollow of his hand, and seeing it twine about his fingerS, they cried out,

and hailed the g0d; congratulating their happy city on the event, and all
running with open mouths to pray to him for riches, good fortune, health,
every thing, in ssiort, that every body wished sor. He ran home as fast as
he could, carrying with him his infant AEsculapius, not born once only as

other
