Next to him, what think you of Ψ Aristippus the Cyrenian, was not he
one of your most celebrated philosophers ?

Most undoubtedly,

He also lived in Sicily at the same time, and was a parafite to Dionysius,
who held him in the highest estcem; his genius, indeed, appeared, above all
men, best adapted to that art, insomuch, that the tyrant would every day

send his cooks to be instruf‘oed by him ε he secum, indeed, to have been one
of the greatest ornaments of our profeffion.

The next l shall mention, is your famous Plato, ‘who travelled into Sicily
for this very purpose, who prastised this ,art at the ψ tyrant's court for a few
days, but failed frorn want of natural capacity: after which, he returned to
Athens, took a great deal of pains to qualify himself, and once more set sail
for Sicily, where, tryinga little while, he again met with as bad success

through utistilfulness; his missortune, indeed, in this particular, resembles

the fate ofss Nicias.

Who mentions this affair, Simo?

’⁶‘ Argstiqus] This satire on Aristippus is very fais: it is well known that philosopher lived
a great part of his time in the court of Dionysius the Sicilian tyrant; and, as he acknowleged
himself, fora very good [eas0n3 ‘⁶ when l wanted wisdom, (said he to the king,) Ι went to so.
crates ς now l want money, l corne to you.'’ He fellslovvn at she king’s feet to ask a favour of

him, which was granted, and being reproved for his meanness and servility; ἒ* Blame me not,
said he, but Dionyfius, whose ears are in his feet.⁰'

† Urant’s, &c.] Dionysius, to which he resorted, but not being altogether of so 'compliant a
disposition as AEschines and Aristippus, did not meet with the same encouragemenn he ssaid
there, however, long enough to rank amongst Lucian's parafites‚ and to be handeddown as
suth, (with what degree of truth we know not) to posterity. ἡ

the sea-fight between the Athenians and Lacedaemonians.

§ At-ssaxcnus.] He lived in the reign os Alexander the Crem, and was a sontemporary of
Plato and Aristotle; eminent both as a philosopher and a mufician, but most distinguished in
the latter charmei: haring written several learned treatises on ancient music, ofwhich only
his Harmonics, in three books, are come down to us; they are transsated into Latin by Meurfius.
He is said by Snidas to have written no less than 452 different works, amongst which, those on
music were most etleerned.

For a further account of him and the merit of his Harmonics, Ι refer my readers to the inge.

works published in this centur) . See his Account ot' the Greek Music, p. 450.
