And now 1 will repeat to you a dialogue between Glycon and a priest of
Tios; how senfible a one he was, you will perceive by his questions. I read
it in his own house, written in letters of gold.

Tell me, great Glycon, who are you ?-1 am AEsculapius the Younger,
not the same as the first-‚How can that be .>-That you must not enquire
into—How many years do you intend to stay with us, and give oracles ?--·
One thousand and three years.—-And where do you go to then ?-T0 Bae-
tria, and the regions round about3 for it is fitting that the Barbarians also
should enjoy the bleffings of my presence—Have the other oracles, those of
Claros, Didymos, and Delphos, Apollo for their father and inspirer, or are
they only false and lying prophets ?—That also enquire not of, for it is not
lawful to reveal.-What strall I be, after this life ?—A camel, after that a
horse, and after that a wisc man, and a prophet, not inferior to Alexander-—

Such was the conversation of the priest and Glycon, which he concluded„
with an oracle in verse, knowing him to be a friend of Lepidus,—

trouble by it. You, Alexander, said thisv man, persuaded the president of
Gallo-Graecia to accuse his servants of a capital crime, and affert that they
had ssain his son, who was one of your disciples‚ though the young man is
now alive, having returned safe horne after the conviffion of the servants,-
who were devoured by wild beasts on your accusation. The fa& was this 31
the young man, who had been sailing, and driven by the rapidity of the·
stream a good way up into AEgypt, was persuaded to go on to India, and·'=
. not returning, the unfortunate servants imagined he must have perished 0111
the Nile, or had been seized by robbers, of which there was great abun-
dance in those parts: they went back, therefore-,2 and* reported that he wasrss
lost3 then followed the oracle and the condemnation, after which the youth?
returned and- gave an account of his voyage. Alexander, enraged at this-
speeeh, and knowing it was but too true, ordered those who were‘present to
stone him, thrcatcning, if they did not, to inflict the same punishment on·
them, as accomplices with him3 they accordingly began to execute his

commanda,
