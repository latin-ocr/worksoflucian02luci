ON TaEsYRIANGODDESS. 497

the Byblians consideras an emblem of their rnisfortune, believing that at
this season Adonis was wounded, and that his blood tinged the sea, and gave
the name to it. Such is the opinion of the vulgar: but a man os Brblis
gave me a different account of it, and affigned another cause: the iiver
Adonis, said he, flows through Libanus, which contains much red earth,
which the winds drive into the river, and make it as red as blood,· it is nor
the blood therefore that causes this appearance, but the nature of the soil.
This the Byblian told me, which may probably be true; though the wind’z-
constantly blowing the same way seems to have something in it super-na-
tural. Δ
From Byblus I ascended in one day to Libanus, where I heard there was
an ancient temple of Venus, built by Cinyras; this Ι saw, and it seemed to
be of great antiquity. These are all the old temples of any fize in Syria,
and amongst them is none so large as that of Hierapolis, or so magnificent;
none where there is such aprofufion of ornaments, so many offerings con-
stantly made, or where the divinity is so immediately present; the statues
are frequently observ-ed to swear, to move about, and to deliver oracles; and
loud voices are often heard by many when the temple is ssiut up. With re·
gard to riches, of which I was an eye-witness, it is undoubtedly the first in
the world ς great treasures are brought into it from Arabia, from the Phoe-
nicians, Babyloniam, and Cappadocians, from the Cilicians also, and the
AffyrianS. 1 saw a great quantity of rich clothes hid in private parts of the
temple, with other thingS, equal in value to the gold and filver in itz'and
for public rites and festivals, no place upon earth has, perhaps, so great an
abundance of them. WhenI enquired into the antiquity of the place, and
the worship of the deity, they told me several stories, some os a public,
others of a private nature, together with many fabulous repom, both Gre-
cian and Barbarian, which 1 {hall here relate, though 1 do not vouch for
the truth of them. ἱ
The common people say that the temple was founded by * Deucalion,
the Scythian‚ in whose time the great † inundation happened. The story
