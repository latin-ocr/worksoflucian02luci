the gods, the predistion, I mean, of future events, you seem totally to
have forgotten3 nor dol remember, that, in any part of your works, you
have followed the steps of ’ΞΕ Calchas, Telephus, Polyidus, or Phineus, who,
you knOW, were no poets, and yet were able to divine, and always ready to
give an answer to those who consulted them about futurity.

You are liable, therefore, to one of the three following accusations:
either, first, you have been guilty of a falsehoml, which, to be sure, is a
bitter suspicion, in telling us that the Muses had bestowed this faculty upon
you, which they have never done; or, secondly, they have given it you
according to their promise, and you, fron] mere grudging and sellissincl's,
with-hold the gift, and will not impart it to those who stand in need of irg
or, thirdly‚ and lastly, you have already written a great many things os
this kind, but have never yet publist1ed them, reserving all their profit and

self? and as the gods are the † authors of every good, so is it the peculias
duty of their friends and servants, such as you are, to tell all you know
with the striffi‘test regard to nuth, and, if we have any doubts or scruples,

to resolve thern for us.

every thing which is said in my verses was not dietated by me, but by the
Muses; from them alone, therefore, you are to ask the reason, both for
what is done, and for what is not done : what Ι wrote from niy own know-
lege, with regard to the feeding, guarding, milking, and driving of flocks,
and other pastoral affairs, Ι am answerable for, myself3 but the goddeffes
have a right to bestow their own favour-s on whom, and in what proportion,
they think prope—r.

But, to make a poetica] defenee, it may suffice to say‚that nobody enquires,
with scrupulous nicety andexa&ness, intotheassertionsos poets, nor exper that
every thing they say ss10u1d be literally true; nor is it fair, if, in the warmth
