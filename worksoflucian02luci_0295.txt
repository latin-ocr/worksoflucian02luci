who is anointed with oil, and rolled in the mud besides, is no easy talk:
all this, as I before observed to you, may be usesul in tiinc of war, if you
want to carry offa wounded friend, or to lift up an enemy whom you have
taken: for this reason we use them to the most violent exercises, reaching
them first the most difficult things, that those which are less so may be per--
formed by them with the greater facility3 the sand, moreover, prevents
their ssipping away from each other; besides that, when spread over the
body, it keeps in the sweat, makes them stronger, and hinders the cold air
from entering into their open pores; it likewise wipes off the filth, and
makes. the man appear more neat and clean. I am sure you would prefer
one of these to our delicate youth that are brought up in the ssradc, even
without puttingtheir abilities to the proof, as you would find the body of
the one firm, solid, and compa&, ofthe other sofr, pale, and bloodless.

Thus, my friend, do we exercise our youth, hoping by these means to
render them the guardians of our city, and supporters of the common-weal,
that they will defend our liberties, conquer our enemies, and make us fear'd
and respee‘ced by all around us: in peace they become better subjee‘cs, are
above any thing that is base, and do not run into vice and debauchery from
idleness, but spend their leisure in these useful employments. 1 call this,
therefore, a common good, and the greatest happiness which we enjoy, that
our young rnen are thus prepared for peace and war, aud are always thus
engaged in what is both innocent and praise-worthy.

Ifthen, Solon, you are at any time invaded by your enemies, you have
nothing to do but to anoint yourselves with oil, sprinkle the dust over your
bodies, and fall upon them3 they, to be sure, will run away immediately,
being afraid, as well they may, that you will throw the sand in their faces,
or, getting behind them with agility‚ twist your legs round, and prel‘s them
to death: then your archers will cast their darts at them, you, in the mean
time, will stand like so many impenetrable statue53 you who take your co-
lour from the sun, ¹and have such a quantity of blood in you ; you are no
chaff and stubble‚ to be destroyed immediately, though, perhaps, at last,
and by very deep wounds‚ they may draw a little blood from y0u3 for so,
iflunderstand you right, it must happen3 it is odds, moreover, but you
will borrow arms from your players, and when you rush out upon the ene-
my, put on their gaping vizards to appear formidabie, and strike terror into
