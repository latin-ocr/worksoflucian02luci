ΤΗῑ COMPLETE ORATOR. 303

bia, and after paffing through a long desert, on to AEgypt: this gave Alex·
ander no little uneafiness, as he had heard the AEgyptians were planning
something against him, and wanted much to give orders to his satraps con—
cerning them. At this time it was, that a Sidoniam merchant said to him,
“ I can promise, O king, to shew you a 'very short way from Persia to
AEgypt3 let a man but get over those mormanus, which he may do in three
days, and he will be there immediatel> .'’ And such was really the case, lint
Alex-ander would not believe the merchant, and called him an impostor:
the improbability ofrhe promise ever being fulfilled rendered it absolutely

incredible to the multitude.
But do not you imitate them, for you will soon know by experience, that

nothing can hinder you from being a complete orator in less than a day's
time, by flying with me over the mountain from Perfia into AEgypt: but,
before we set off, let me shew you, by an allegory, in the manner of ⁴* Ce-
bes, both the roads, for there are two which leads to that oratory which you
seem so ambitious to obtain. Observe then, fitting on an eminence, a beauti-
ful figure, bearing in her right hand the horn of Amalthaea‚ filled with fruit
of every kind ; imagine that on the other side, you behold the amiable Plutus
all over gold, by their fide are glory and power, with a number of praises and
compliments, like so many little Cupids, embracing each other, and ssuttering
about you ; just as you have seen the Nile represented leaning on a crocodile,
or Hippopotamos, with boys playing round him, which they call the
ἦ- cubits of AEgypt3 such are the praises that hover round an orator. Ap-
proach then, fond lover, ascend the eminenee, and there receive rhy bride,
with riches, glory, and applause, for these are all the lawful right ofhim
who shall espouse her. When you come near to the mountain, at first you

will, perhaps, despair of ever getting to the top of it; it will appear as
Aornos did to the Macedoniam, so inaccesfible, that even the birds can
scarce fly up to it, and requires the strength of a Bacchus, or Hercules, to

take posseffion of it. But yon will soon perceive two paths that lead up to

ἃ Cebes] The Thebani Philosopher‚ and disciple of SocrateS, author of the famous allegory

os the Tabula Cebetis.

from the antique statue here alluded to, representing the river Nile, under the figure of an old
man crowned with lumel, and leaning on his elbow with a cornucopia in his hand, on his arms,
shoulders‚ and thighs, are sixteen naked bow, fignifying so many cubirs, the height of the
river, when it overflows, and entiches the whole territory of AEgypt.
