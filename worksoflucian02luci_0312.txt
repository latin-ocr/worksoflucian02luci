306 Tur. COMPLETE ORATOR.

figureS, and amongst the rest au ’ἃ all-knowing and beautiful man, with an
untlulating motion in his gait, and his head bent on one fide, a soft voice,
and an effeminate countenance, touching his head gently with the tip of
his finger, and adjusting his curled hyacinthine locks, like SardanapaIuS,
Cyniras, or † Agatho himself, the famous handsome tragic poet: you will
know him by these marks; let not, I beseech ycu, so divine a figure, one
so dear to Venus and the Graces, escape your observation; but how can Ι
suppose it should ! for when he shall approach you, even though you were
blind, and open, which suits admirably with a white hat, that ζ Hymettian
mouth of his, with its accustomed sweetness, you will soon perceive that he
is not one of us common people, who live upon the fruits of the earth, but
some foreign and miraculous creature, fed with dew and ambrosia: to him,
ir· you confign yourself, you will immediately become a famous orator, or,
as he calls himself, a ᾗ king of words, and ride in the chariot of eloquence;

for he will soon teach you every thing.

But let him speak for himself3 ridiculouS, indeed, would it be in me, to
harangue for such an orator3 1 should but spoil the part os so great a hero,
uere 1 to attempt to perform it: let him, therefore, address you, as soon
as he has stroked down his little foretop, and given you one of his soft
beautiful smiles, with a voice like Glycera, Malthace, or the great comie
ΙΙ Thais herself; in this modest manner then, will he, perhaps, speak of

himself:
“ Did the Pythian oracle send you here ? and did it inform you that I was

the prince of orators, as it told qs Chaerephon of old, who was the wisest of
men ? if it be not so, and urged by the love of glory‚ you come of your own

⁸ An all—knowing, Εὕα] It is supposed, as 1 observed in the first note, that Lucian here meant
to ›satir'ise Julius Pollux-3 but this ιε by no means clear.

† Agr gaska] This famous tragic poet is mentioned by Aristotle m his Poetics, and by the
s hol iasts >n Aristophanes.13ut⁵10r the fullest account of him, 1 ieter the curious reader to the
learned Bentley' s Dissertation on the Epistles of Euripides.

1 Hjm zm.- an ι.] Alluding to the mountain of Hy mettuS, so famous forits honey.

ᾖ Ki mg ofer t·‚ords &c .] Ridiculous expreffions probably quoted from the works of the un-
tortunate author, now· 11÷ppi1y [οι himself,) configned to oblivion‚ whom Lucian meant to

expose.

fl Thais lvsrstlfl] Luciam calls her Αιιτοθως, the great Thais, or Thais herself. In the same
manner in his Timon, he calls Boreas Αυτο Βορεας, ipsemet Boream an uncommon expreffion,
l believe, and peculim· to this‘ author.

ql Cher-epham] Who, we are told, enquired of the Pythian oracle, who was the wisest of
men ἓ the oracle returned for auswer, socrates.
