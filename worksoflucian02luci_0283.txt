fides over the sport‚ for by the purple I take him to be a magistrate, never
offers to part them, or put an end to the fray, but seems to encourage and
promote it, as you see by the applauses he bestows on that bruiser. But

No wonder, Anacharsis, they should seem so to you, as these customs
must appear strange and foreign to your Scythian manners; and so would

This place is called the † Gymnafium, and is sacred to Apollo the Ly-
cian. Observe his statue, the head reclining on his right hand, with a bow
in his left, represents the deity as rising from long labour : with regard to
the exercises, what you observe in the rnud there, aud likewise on the saud,

which they always wore, both in peace and war; it was even treated with some degree of udo-
ration, and worshipped by them. See Lucian’s Toxaris, and the note upon it.

-'† Gymnasium] Th gymnasium, or palaestra, was the place where all the public exercises
were performed, divi dimo several parts, which are all accurately and minutely described by
Pausanias, V itruvius, Portet, andother writers.
