SATURNALIAN EPISTLES. 477

tiles shall smell of fifh, your boars and stags run out of· the kitchen,
your liens fly off to the poor, your glaffes be all broke, and your pages
be all baldt.' For the future, therefore, take qai-e that my festival be ce-
lebrated as it ought to be, and that you relieve the poor and indigent,
whom, by a little timely affistance, you may make most excellent and useful

friends.

ANSWER oF ΤΗΕ RICH To SATURN.

NOT to you alone, O saturn, have the poor made their complaints:
Jupiter is every day stunned with their clamours, importuning him to make
a new distribution of things, accufing Fat‘e of inequality ancl injustice‚ and
ι us also for bestowing nothing upon them; but he knows very well where

the fault lies, and therefore turns a deaf ear to their petitions. For our-
selves‚ we have confidered of what you wrote to us, are convinced that it is
our duty to relieve the indigent, and that to admit the poor to our feast will
make them more agreeable to ourselves, and have therefore taken care to ”
give them such an equa] portion as may remove all just cause of eomplaint
amongst them. But the truth is, these men, who at first pretended they
wanted but little, when once our doors were opened to them, were per-
petually aiki'ng for more and more; and if their request was not immediate-
ly complied with, we met with nothing but ill-will, anger, and abuse from
them; if any lie was propagated against υς, it was soon as thoroughly be-
lieved by the croud as if they knew it to be true; so that we are reduced to
this alternative, ifwe give them nothing, to make them our inveterate ene-
mies3 or if we permit them to take all, to be as poor as them, and become
beggars ourselves ι this might be borne, but which is still worse, when they
are invited, they never think they have enough, and yet after gorging them·
selves, and drinking a great deal more thau they ought, they make no
scruple of endeavouring in their cups to debauch your wife or mistress3 and
whilst they are puking upon your best bed, rail at and abuse you, and com-
plain ofbeing star-ved. If you think this impoffible‚ recolle& the story of
your own parasite Ixion, who when admitted to the table of the gods, got

drunk, and most generoussy made an attempt on the chastity of Juno.

Such,
