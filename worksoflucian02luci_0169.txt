Who shall dare to contend for precedence with me, the immense C010s.

. for the money that I eost them3 by the rule of proportion‚ therefore, I should
be placed above thern all; belides that, you should consider the art and ex-

What is to be done in this affair, Jupiter? it is a diffieulr. point to ‹ieter-

What does he come amongst us for ? only to disgrace our diminutive fize,
and throw the assembly into conft1fi0n3 hark you, most noble Rhodian, if
we give you precedence here, and place you before the golden ones, how
will you contrive to take your seat, unless they all rise up to give you roorn,

huge and immense representation of Apollo, or the Suu, worshipped by the Rhodiam. The
ancient historiam, who are very apt to fib 01i these occasions, tell us, that it was seventy cubits
high; or, according to Festus, a hundred and five feet long, all of brass, the work ofone Chares,
a disciple of the famous statuary Lyfippus3 its feet were placed on two immensely high rocks or
pedeslals, at the entrance of the port of Rhodes, and at such a distance from each other, that
strips in full sai! passed in between them. Pliny informs us, that about fifty-fix years after its
ereffim, it was‘ laid flat, and remained in that condition till the time of Vespnfian, who set it
up again. When the Saracena became masters of Rhodes, they found it again thrown doun,
and sold it for an immense sum to a Jew, who took it to pieces, and carried off the brass it ww:
made of, on nine hundred camels. The thumb‚ it seems, was as much as a man could well span
with his two arms, and every finger was as large as a common statue.
