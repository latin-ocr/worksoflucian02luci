terni it ‘the pancratium: we have likewise other sports, such as *boxing,
quoits, and leaping, for every one of which we lay down certain rewards,
which the conqueror is entitled to.

And what are they?
S Ο L O N.

At the Olympio games, an 3 olive crown, or garland; at the Isthmian,
one of pine; at the Nemean, one of parssey3 at the Pythian, apples from
the trees sacred to Apollo; and with υς, 3ῑ the Panathenaica, olives from
the trec of Minerva. What do you stnile at? you think our prizes very

small, [suppose.

O n0; your rewards are certainly most magnificent, and such as must stit·
up a contest atnongst the donors which shall be most liberal, worthy‚ no
doubt, to be contended for by the candidates, even beyond their strength :
they must take a great deal of pains, to be sure, and willingly run the hazard
of being throttled for apples and parssey, as if they could not have plenty
of them when they pleased, without having their faces smeared with mud,
and their breaths trod out of their bodies for it.

SOLON.

But remember‚ my friend, it is not th‘e reward alone which we look to-
wards : these are only the marks and tokens of victory z the glory which re-
sultsfrom it, is the conqueror‘s great reward: those who look for glory,
and thirst after that alone, must suffer many things, and wait for it as the
noble and worthy end of all their labours.

ANACHARSLS.

The great and noble end, you talk of then, is, that those, who before
pivied them for their wounds and dangers, shall applaud their vietor-ies, and
see them crowned : whilst they shall themselves be supremely happy in the
pofl'cliion of their apples and parssey.

ss Oliva] The first reward bestowed upon the conquerors in the Olympic games was a chap-
lct‚ or crown, composed ofthe branches of wild olive, to enhance the value of which, it was
pretended, that the tree from whence they were taken was brought to Olympia by Hercules,
{torn the countryofthe Hyperboreum, and withal, that it was indicated to the Eleans by the
Dtlphic oracle. Sec West‘s Diss‘ercation on the Olympio Gan-res.
