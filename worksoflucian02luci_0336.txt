offices, he would pronounce another magio verse, and immediately it be-
came a broom, or a pestle again: but this secret, with all 1 could do, 1
was never able to get from him, he did not chuse to impart it, though in
every thing else he was always ready to oblige me. One day, however, I
stood by him in a dark place, and privately overheard the charin, which was
only of three syllables, after which he went out, giving the necessary order-s
to his pest1e3 and the day after, he having some bufiness in the market-
place, 1 took my little pestle also, dressed it up, and repeating the three
syllables, commanded it to fetch me some water; when it had filled the cask,
leave off, said 1, bring me no more, but be a pestle again; it did not, how-

full of it. Not knowing what to do (for I was afraid of Pancrates's return-

the pestle in two, but both the parts thus severed took the pitchers and drew
water, so that instead of one servant I had now two; at this time in carne

form, for he would continue drawing water till the house swam with it.’'

‘⁶ W'111 you never have done, interrupted Ι, old as you are, telling such
abominable lies? At least defer your incredible stories to another time, for
the sake of these young rnen, that you may not fill their minds with absurd
rables, and unreasonable fears3 spare thern, I beseech you, and do not use
then: to listen to such things as will dwell upon and disturb them for their

whole lives, fill then: with dreadful superstitious, and make thern afraid of
every noise they hear.'’

servant-making to posterity: the blundet of Arignotus, and his splitting the pestle is extremely
laughable.
