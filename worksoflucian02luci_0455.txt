without ever changing 'their habit or their posture; but in this there is no<
thing so extraordinary, for I saw itjust now done at Olympia, where, 1 sup-
pose, you were also an eye-witness of it, when the old man died there.

Ι did not go to Olympia for fear of those wretches: Ι just now told you
of many whom 1 saw crouding thither on purpose to abuse the people as-
sembled, and to prophane the temple with their noise and ribaldry3 1 never
saw him, therefore, nor know how he perished. But to proceed: from the
Brachmans Ι fiew immediately to AEthiopia, and from thence into AEgypt;
hercl held communion with the priests and prophets, and taught them di-
vine things·, I visited Babylon, and initiated the Magi and Chaldeans;
thence passed into Scythia, and from thence to Thrace, where 1 was met by
Orpheus and Eumolpus: these I sent before me into Greece, the one by
song and music to harmonize the minds of men, the other to inculcate the
sacred doetrines which he had learned from me3 and strait I followed them.
The Grecians, at my first coming, neither strictly embraced, nor turned
their backs upon me, After l had sojourned with them a little time, Ι
prevailed on ἦ seven to become my friends and disciples; together with one
from ἦ* Samos, one from 111 Ephesus, and one from ξ Abdera, but a few in
all. After these, lknow not how it happened, that a nation of sophists
came about me, a set of men, neither firmly attached to my precepts, nor
utterly abhorrent from them; a kind of ΙΙ centaurS, a mixed and imperfe&
tace, something between philosophy and imposture, neither totally the ssaves
of ignorance, nor keeping their eyes stedfastly fixed on me3 like those who
are half-blind from dimness of fight, they sometimes grasped at an empty
shadow, or weak image of me, they thought, at the sanie time, that they
knew every thing perfeetly3 whence arose that useless and superfluous wis<
dom amongst them, which, notwithstanding, they considered as invincible :
hence those subtle distinctions, those intricate and abstnd arguments, which,
like labyrinths, only confounded, and perplexed mankind.

θ’ Seven] The seven wise meu of Greece, Pittacus, Bias, Thales. Periander, Cleobult„
Chilon, Solon.

ἦ· Samos] Pythagoras.

ζ Ephffus.] Heraclitus.

ξ Abdera] Democritus.
Η Centaurs.] Half-men and half-horfes, as the men he describes were lum-philosoph< rs ,1er
half· rascals; the com'parison is excellent.
