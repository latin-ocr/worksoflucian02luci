happinesa of sne cloaths and rables, nor the pleasure of shaving and smooth-
ing every part of their bodies, leaving nothing as nature had made it.

For my own part, Ι hope my feet may be like horses hoofs, as they
say Ch'non's were; that Ι shall never want a bed on the ground like the
lions; nor do 1 defire better food than the dogs. May the earth still be
my cou'ch3 the whole world my house; and may Ι always eat what can
most eafily be procured for me ! Never may 1, or any of my friends, want
gold or silves! from a thir-st after them, proceed war, ssaughter‚ sedition,
treason, and every evil thing : from this fountain they all flow. Far from
me be the defire of having more than 1 ought to have! may 1 always be
contented with less ἵ

Ihave given you my opinion, which is very unlike that of the multi-
tude ; and as 1 differ from them in doctrine, it is no wonder Ῑ should differ
from them in my appearance also. Ι am surprised, therefore, when you see
fidlers and flute-players‚ and αξὶοῑε, chuse their own habits, that you will
not suffer an honest man to chuse his, but expe& he must wear such a one
as that multitude does, whom he despises. And why may he not put on
that which becomes him best, and which the great and luxurious most abhor?
Now, my taste is to be rough and ditty ; to wear a ragged cont, and long hair,
and go without ssroes3 whilst you dress like so many ²2 fribbles, have as
many garments, as fine ffioes, are as much scented, and take as much pains
with your hair 3 you are just as unfit to bear any exercise or labour : eat like
them, and walk like them, or rather indeed you do not walk at all, but
are carried like burthem, sometimes by men, and sometimes by horses.
Now my feet can bear me wherever 1 choose ὦ go. Ι can bear heat and
cold, and am not angry with the works of nature whenever Ι chance to be
out of humour3 whilst you are not contented with any thing you possess,
but find fault with all : the present you cannot bear, and the absent you
are always fighing for ε in winter you wish for summer, and in summer for
winter-3 when it is hot, you cry out sor cold, and when it is cold you want
henr, never satisfied with your condition, but like fick rnen, nauseating
every thing that is set before you: their disorder is sufficient cause, but
your discontent is nothing but peevishness and ill humour: and yet you
want meto tetra& my opinions; to deliberate and confidet well the pro-
priety of my conduec, though at the same time you have no consideration
