To our dearly beloved

H O W, my good friend, could you be so absurd as to write to me about
the present state of human affairs, enjoining me to make a more equal distri-
bution of things? this is not my busmess, but belongs to ‘him who is now
the great governor. Ι arn surprised to find, you are the only one who (1Ὶ ςς
not knOW, that I, who formerly held the reins, am no θ longer ruler, hav-
ing divided the empire amongst my children, and that the care of all these
things belongs now to Jupiter: my power is confined to dice, finging, and
drinking, aud that only for seven days: for your request, therefore, to re-
form these inequalities, and set you all upon a level, I must refer you to
Jove, who alone is answerable for them. If, indeed, during my festival,
any injury is committed through fraud, avarice, or injustice, Iffiall take
cognizance of it; ·and for that purpose, I have written to the rich with
regard to their suppers, their gold, and garments, and ordered them to send
you some army festival; this, as you say, is but just and right, and they
will do as they ought, unless they can produce any good reasons to the con-
trary.

In the mean time, permit rne to inform you, the poor and indigent, that
you are much deceived in your opinions concerning the rich and great : to
think that they alorie are-happy, and live a life of pleasure, because they
have costly suppers, get drunk with sweet wine, and are clothed in soft gar-
ments : you know not the reaxl truth, nor how much care and trouble these
things bring along with them3 they are obliged to warch continually that
their stewards may not neglect their affairs, or cheat and impose upon them,
to take care that their wine does not grow sour, and their corn r0t3 that some
thief does not steal away their cups, that informers do not make the popu-
lace believe that they mean to establish tyranny and arbitrary power. These
are not a thousandth part of the miseries they are subjectt03 if you knew
halfthe terrors and uneafiness they undergo, riches were the very things which

you would most wilh to avoid. .
Befides all this, if there was a'ny thing so very defirable in riches and em·
