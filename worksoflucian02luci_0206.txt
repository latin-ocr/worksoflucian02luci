mans, the Metapontians, the Tarentines, and the rest of the poor deluded

³⁹ Golden thigh] Porphyry tells us (credat Judaeus), that at the‘ public solemnity of the
Olympio games, Pythagoras stood up and shewed to all the people his golden thigh, as he did
in private to Ahar-is, to confirm him in the opinion that he was Hyperborean Apollo; Abaris,
we are to observe, was Apollo⁷s chief priest.

'i Beana] Pythagoras, seeing one day an ox in a pasture at Tarentum, who had so little re-
gard to his precepts as to eat green beans, desired the master of the ox to diffuade him from such
indecency, but the neat-herd‚ informing him that he really could not speak the language of
oxen, the philosopher himself stepped up to the bea'st, and whispered something in his ear,

after which time the ox never touched a bean, lived many years in a field near Juno’t temple,
and was called the sacred ox.

This story is very gravely told by Porphyry and Jamblichus.
