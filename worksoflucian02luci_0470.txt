464 SATURNALIA:

S A T U R N.

You are afking me questions, my friend, when we ought to be drinking ε
you have robbed me of half my holiday in philosophifing, most unneceffarily3
let us, therefore, talk no more, but feast and enjoy our liberty3 after which
we will play at dice for muts, according to the old custorn, appoint our kings
’ of the feast, and do as they bid us. So shall we fulfil the proverb,

³¹⁶ Once a man, and twice a child.

P R 1 E S Τ.

Well said ε never may he drink when he is dry, who does not approve thy
pleasantry ! so, let us drink, for you have answered excellently. I have a
great mind to put down what has passed between us in a book, for the use
of those, amongst tny friends, who are worthy of such an entertaintnent.

⁸' Once a man, ζέω] Gr. παλιμπαιὲας τεςγερωτας, senes bis pueros. The Greek and English
saying or proverb answer exaffly. The phrase in our own language is, perhaps, the most strong
and expreffive.

CHRO·
