'raiz FALSE PROPHET. 3

tus. He wrote once toliis brother-in-law Rutilianus, and modeslly coni-
pared himself to Pythagoras. Pythagoras, heaven shicld mc! was a wisc
man, and full of the divinity3 but had he lived when Alexander did, he
would have been a boy to him. Ι do not mean, I swear by tlic Graecs, by
this to refle& on Pythagoras, or to compare them together with rcg32nd to
their ειὲὶίοηε. Bur, if we were to put together every thing which calumitj:
has suggested against Pythagoras, and which Igive no credit to, it would
not amount to half the craft and iniquity which was to be sound in Alexan-
der. Imagine to yourselfa disposition of mind perpetually shifting‚ made up

who praffise magio arts and incantations, love potions, philters, and charms
to find hidden treasures‚ subdue enemies, and get estates. This fellow find-
ing him an ingenious lad, and fit for any kind of mischies, instrueted him,
and took him into his service. He was himself by profeffion a physician al-
so, and, like the '³4' wife of Thoon the AEgyptian, could,
