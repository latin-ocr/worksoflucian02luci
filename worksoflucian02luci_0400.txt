394 ENCOMIUMONAHOUSE.

Beyond this is a very ancient piece, of ⁴* Orion blind, carrying Cedalion„
who shews him the way to the light3 the Sun rising cures him of his blind-
ness. Vulcan sees the whole from Lemnos.

And now comes ἶ Ulyffes seigning madness, to excuse himself from go·
ing on the expedition with the Atridae: the ambaffadors are inviting him,
his excuse is plaufible, his charior, his horses of different colours, his pre-
tended ignorance of every thing to be done3 but the boy discovers him.
Palamedes, understanding how the affair was, snatche's away Telemachus,
seigns himself in a violent rage, draws his sword, and threatens to kill him.
Ulyss'es is alarmed and terrified, drops his diffembled character, puts on the
father, ancl is restored· to his senses immediately.

The last pieture is Medea, enflamed with jealousy‚ looking fiercely at her
children, as if meditating something dreadful, and with a sword in her
hand; the little ones, ignorant of their future fate, fit with smiling coun-
tenances, and whilst they see her holding the sword over them, seem pleased
and happy.

And noW, judges, do ye not perceive that all-this must draw afide the at-
tention of the audience, and leave the orator unnoticed and alone? What I
have now said was not with any defign to prejudice my opponent in your
opinion, but only that I might convince you how difficulta task we had both·
under-taken, and to persuade you, if poffible, to listen to us: even now you
must be our friends rather than our judges‚ before you can think us equal t0;
such a subject: wonder not that I thus plead for my adversary as well as for
myself; so great is my regard for this house, 1 cannot but wish well to all„
whoever they be, that speak in praise of it.

* Orsum] The son of Neptune; he is represented as a giant, and is said to have fallen iu
love with Merope, of the issand of Chios, whose father, Oenopion, dissiking the match, con-
trived‚ when he was drunk, to put out his eye3‚ and leave him on the sea shore, where meet-
ing with a ratmer’s boy, he took him on his shoulders, by way ofguide, to condo& him to the
place where the sun ri ses; which, the story adds, perfedffly recovered his sight, and gave him
the opportunity of revenging himself on Oenopion. This accounts for the additional tale of
his intr-igue with Aurora, and thejealousy of Diana, as mentioned by Homer.

† Ugvffis] This story is too well known to want any illustration ; it is a very good subje& for
a pksture, and 1 would recommend it to that ingenious claffical painter SignoraAngelica Kaaffman.
