breaking in upon them, and had not been heard of fince. The servants,
apprised of their young master and mistress's fate, resolved to romain no

longer in ssavery, but getting what they could out of the house, made the
best of their way off. The ffiepherd, who looked after the mares, packed
up all he could find, and put it on our baeks3 Ihad, for my own part,
as great a buthen as an ass could well carry, but still thought myself happy
that 1 had escaped docking. For that night, and three days after, we had a
hard and dreadfuljourney‚ but at length arrived at Beraea‚ a famous city in
Macedonia. Here our drivers rested us and themselves; the beasts were then
all put up to sale, and we were cried in the market-place. The chapmen
came, looked into our mouths, and examined all our teeth ; one bought one,
and another another, but 1 was still left behind, and the crier bade them
drive me back again, for nobody would bid for me; when my unlucky fate,

purchased ι when they saw it was an ass, they cried‚ “ What sort ofa spouse
have you brought us here? pray take him yourself‚ for we want no such
cattlc.”

The next day they began to set themselves serioussy to work, dressed up
their goddess, and placed her upon me3 then, quitting the town, we rambled
over the fields, and when we came to a village, I, as bearet of the divinity‚
was stopped, and stood still; immediately a parce] of minstrels played some
solemn tunes, then a croud of them hung their heads down, and twisting their
necks round, lolled out their tongues, and pricked both them and their
shoulders with lanc-ets, so that the blood ‘flowed on every fide of them. Ι
