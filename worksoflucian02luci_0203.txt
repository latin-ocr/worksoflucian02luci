Tm: COCKAND THECOBLER. 197

Simo, with his tattered coar, he that stole my pan, inherited all his estate,
and immediately became a great man, appeared in his purple and scarler, j
hadvhis ssaves, his charior and horfes, gold cups, rables with ivory feet3
was, in short, so fiattered and worshipped, that he soon forgot me: when
Imet him the other day, I saluted him with, “ Your servant, Sinio ;'' when he
put himselfinto a violent paffion, and crit-d out, “ Tell that beggar not to
clip my name so, I am not called Simo now, but Simonides.” But what is
most extraordinary is, the women are fond of him; he gives himselfairs,
pretends to be coy, admits sorne to his favour ; whilst others threaten to de-
stroy themselves, if he will not take notice ofthem. You see what gold can
do, that makes the crooked streight, the ugly handsome, that, like the poeti·
cal Caestus, bestows grace and beauty. Hear how the poets praise it,

* Ο gold, thou best and greatest good on earth.
And again,
Gold rules o’er human things with sov'reign sway.

What do you smile at?

To see you, like the rest of the multitude, so deceived and mistaken in
your notions of the rich and great, who are much more miserable than your-
selves3 this I can affure you of, who have been rich and poor, and therefore
know both conditions by experience3 you shall know by and by every par-

ticular.

And so 1 will, by Jove: for now it is your turn to speak, to tell me what
forms you were changed into, and all that you can recolle& which paffed in ,

each of them.
C O C K.

Listen then, and you shall hear3 but beforeI begin, let me assure you
that I- never yet met with any body who lived more happily than you do.

MICYLLUS.

Than· me? may you bejust as happy then ! for now you really make me
angry. But come, begin with Euphorbus; tell me how you were trans-
formed into Pythagoras, and so on, down to your present appearance as a
Coek: you must have seen and suffered a great deal in so many different
lives.
