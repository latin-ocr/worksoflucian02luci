ANACHARSIS. 287

And ηοω, with rcgard to their bodies, which you seemed particularly in—
quifitive about, I will shew you how we exercise them. first, as soon as
they are able to bear it, we strip them naked, to accustom the-in to the open
air, to inure them to all kinds of weathcr, that thcy may bc able to beas
heat and cold3 we then anoint them with oil, to fit them for more laborious
exertion. It would be absurd, indeed, to suppose, that leather could be
rendered by oil more supple, to last longer, and be less liable to crack, and
that a living body like our own, should not be the better for it: we, therc-
fore, invented¹ various methods of exercise, and appointed masters in evi-ry
one of them ; some wrestle, others box, by which they are enabled to bear
fatigue, and not to faint under wounds and blows; it gives thern spirit to
eneounter difficulties and danger, and at the same time, makes thern hardy
and robust: by frequent throavs, they learn to fall withou‘¹ danger, and to
rise with ease3 by the various inflexions, and squeezings of their bodies,
and lifting up their adversary, and preffing him in their arms, their limbs
are rendered more pliant, and less susceptible of injury3 but the greatest ad-
vantage arifing from hence is, their practice os the same discipline in the field
of battle; as it is manifest, that the man who is thus instructed, if he lays
hold on,his enemy, knows better how to throw him down, or, if he falls
himself, can rise with more ease. To this great purpose, we endeavour to
make every thing subservient, and imagine that those who are thus kept in
constant exercise, will prove the best soldiem, their bodies being thus render-
ed stronger, as well as more supple and fit for engagement. You see what a
figure it is probable those will make in arms, who, even when naked, strikc
their enemies with terror‚· who do not carry about with them a lifeless load
of fiefh, nor lean and pale bodies, like women’s, that wither in the shade,
orvdiffolve in perpetual sweats,respecially if the meridian sun scorches as it
does now. What service can such be of, always thirsting, unable to bear
the heat and dust, who faint at the fight of blood, and die with fear before
they come within reach of a weapon ? but our young warriors are robust and
rosy, borrow their colour from the sun that burns them, of a manly aspeci,
full of warmth, spirit, and courage3 not rough and dry, or bending be—
neath their own weight, but with bodies of due symmetry and proportior),
who have carried off their superfluous flessi by constant labour, and kept
only that which is firm and substantial. Exercise is to the body, what a fan

is to the corn, which blows away the chaff, and dust, and separates it from
