TOXARIS. 9,

exposed to all the dangers of the storm. The Scythia-J esteems nothing st»
much as true friendssiip: there is not any thing which gives hin ruore plea-
sure and satis'faEtion than to partake with his friend of every lorrow and ca-
lamity, nor doth he hold any thing more {hameful and ignoininious than to
desert and betray him3 for this we honour Pylades and Orestes, because
they excelled in that virtue which we most admire: for this reason, we call
them the Coraci, which, in our langnage, fignifies, the gods offriendship.

Ifind, Toxaris, you Scythians are not only famous sor the swiftness of
your arrows, and skill in war, but for your eloquence also. Formerly‚ Ι
own, Ι did not think so of you; but must now confess you seem to hav: a
proper sense ofjustice, by the honours which you pay to Pylades and Orestes:
nor did Ι know, my friend, that you were, yourself, so excellent a punirem
your pietures in the Orestrum, the battle, and the wounds which the noble
friends received for each other, are finely drawn. Ι little thought that
friendship was held in such high esteem amongst the Scythians, whom 1 al·
wayslook'ed on as a savage and inhospitable people, paffionate‚ quarrelsome,
and contentious‚ strangers to friendssiip, even amongst their nearest kindred
and relations; which, Ι was inclined to believe, as well from many other
things thatI have heard concerning them, as frorn their custom of devoun

ing their own parents after death.

With regard to our treatment of, and veneration for our parents, Ι shall
not at present enter into dispute with you ; but that the Scythians are much
more faithful to their friends, and have a better idea of friendship than the.
Greeks, is pasta doubt. By your own gods, I intreat you, therefore, do
not be offended‚ if I tell you what I have remarked, during the long time
⁷ thatl have lived amongst you ε my opinion is, that you talk better about
friendffiip than any other people, but are so far from practifing what you
preach, that you entirely content yourself with only praifing, and ssiewing
what a fine thing it is: when there is the least occasion to exereise this virtue,
you bely your own words, and fall off from your promises. When your
tragedians bring on the stage scenes of‘exalted friendship, you applaucl then]
most furioussy, and sometimes even {hed tears at the representation, though,
at the same tirne, ye will none of you do any thing to serve your own friends:

if they come to want or misery‚ your tragie scenes all fly off as so many
