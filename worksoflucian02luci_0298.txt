292 ANACHARSIS.

Because it makes them more inclined to labour and affiduity, when they
sve the vietum thus crowned with honour and glory by the applause of all
Greece; besides, that being obliged to appear naked, makes them keep
their bodies neat and fit to be seen. As to the rewards, they, as l before ob-
served to you, are by no means inconsiderable3 to be praised by the spaila-
tots, and pointed out as superior to their rivals, is a prize sufficient for them;
add to this, that numbers of the spectators, whose age demands the like ex-
ereil‘e, feel the same ambition of excelling‚ and prepare themselves for la-
bour. Take away the love offame from mankind, and what virtue would re-
main amongst us, οι· who would strive to perform great and splendid aetion„
you may judge from hence how they will fight for their wives and children,
their religion and their country, who, naked and unarmed, shew such an
ardent thirst after victory, when they contend only for apples and wreaths
of olive.

But what would you say if you were to see the battles of our '⁴³' quails, and
ἔγ· fighting cocks! you would smile, no doubt, especially when 1 tell you,
that they are by public appointment3 and that we enjoin our youth, when
they arrive at years of maturity to attend them, and be eye-witneffes of the
courage of these birds who fight till they die : nor is there any thing ridi-
culous in this custom 3 for, hence they learn to despise danger, and are
ashamed to appear less bold and courageous than our cocks, to fink under
any wounds, or be intimidated at any difficulty or inisfortune ; as to putting
arms in their hands, and permitting thern to cut and hack one another, we
think it idle, (affige, and unnecefi'ary, to run the hazard of destroying our
best rnen, who might be of so much service against our enemies.

’ὦ Quails, effa] The fighting of quails is mentioned by several authors, as a favourite diver-
ὕοι) amongst the ancients; “ Circulos faciunt (says Belingerus,) in illisque Coturnices statuunt,
quas ad pugnam inter se stimulant ; Coturnix quae vffita circulo ejicitur cedit domino Coturnicin
vieti-icis? See Jul. Caesar Belingerus de Ludis Veterum.

By this account it appears that they fought in a pit, like our gamercocks. The ancients had,
probably, a great plenty os these martial birds 2 in England they are rather scarce; we, there-
fore, when we cun get, make a better use of them.

† fighting svikn] Our favourite diverfion of cock-figbting has, we see, at least, the plea of
antiquity‚ and, perhaps, it is the only plea it can boast, in favour of it. lt does not,
however, appear that the ancients surnissied them as we do, with any artificial arms to destroy
one another. For a circumstantial account of the places and manner in which these bloody
battles were fought, l reser the curious reader to a Tra& on this subjeei in the Hist. de l’ Acad.
des Inscript‚ anu Belles Lettres.
