90 DEFENCEor rmPORTRAIT.

POLYSTRATUS.
You had better speak as if she was now before you, and then when Ι go to

her, Iwill imitate you.
L Y C I N U S.

We will suppose her, here then if you please‚ and that she has just spoke
what you told rne she did, and now Ι am going to answer her3 yet 1 must
fairly acknowlege to you, the affair becomes dreadfully serious: 1 know not
why, but as you see, 1 absolutely sweat, and am frightened out of my wits-
Ι think I see her before me, and am terrified: Ι must begin, however, for
now she is come, there is no retiring.

POLYSTRATUS.
But see! her countenance is full of benignity, she smiles propitious on»
you; therefore, be confident, and proceed.

Most noble and illustrious lady, lavish as 1 have been of your praises, fot

so you say 1 am3 nothing which Ι ever extolled you for, is equal to your
piety to the gods, which incited you to find fault with your poor admirer z
this is infinitely superior to all Ι ever said of you; you will pardon, if through

one thing, moreover, which I am infinitely obliged to you for, and that is,
when Ι praised your moderatior] and humility, and said that your good for·
tune and prosperity had never made you proud or insolent, you condemn me
for it, and by that very censure confirm the truth of it; for, surely, not
greedily to swallow such praise‚ but to be confounded at, and say you did not
merit, is but to fhew yourself still more deserving of it. One may apply to
you the answer of Diogenes, who, being asked how glory might be acquir-
ed, replied, “ By contemning it :'’ and, if 1 were asszed myself, who was
most worthy of praise, Ι should answer, “ Those who wish not to be praised
at all.’'

But this, you will say, is foreign to the purpose, and has nothing to do
with the cause in hand: Ι stand accused of comparing you, in the picture
