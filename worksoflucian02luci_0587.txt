THE GOUT-TRAGED'Y. 581

Her birth, great Jupiter, to thee,
And to thy brain's prolific throes‚
The war-exciting deity, ,
Minerva, virgin goddess, owes.
Our happier mistress great ’ἴθ’ Ophion bore
ln his soft arms, when, chaos now no more,
Fresh rose the sun, and with refulgent ray,
Dispers’d the gloorn, and lit up chearful day,
Then first great Gout appear'd, from Clotho sprung,
Whilst at her birth the joyful welkin sung,
All heav'n was pleas'd, ev’n griessy Pluto smil’d,
The wealthy god, and nurs’d the darling child.

G O U T Y M A N.
What sacred marks distinguish those who wait
On this all-pow’rful deity, her priests

Seleeoed?
C H Ο R U S.

We pour forth no mystic blood
Before her altars, nor in knotted wreaths
Bind up our hair, nor yield our naked back
To painful stripes, nor feed on the raw flesh
Of bulls ς but when the smiling spring puts forth
His elder buds, and the shrill black-bird fing5‚
Then doth our goddess on her sacred tram,
Infli& the deep-felt wound that pierces sore
Through wrist, foot, ankle, {hin—bone, shoulders‚ arms,
Neck, head, hips, hands, thigh9‚ back, and ev'ry part
Pricks, tears, consumes, burm, poisons‚ and devours.

XGOUTY MAN.

Then am I, goddess, thy true priest, which yet
1 knew not : corne, propitious deity ! -
Here let me join thy followers, here perform
The rites to thee, and hymn the solemn song.

θ Ophion] To saise the dignity and consequence of his goddess, Lucian carries back her
birth to the remotest period of anfiquhy, and makes her coeval with Ophion, who was snpposed
to exist before Saturn.
