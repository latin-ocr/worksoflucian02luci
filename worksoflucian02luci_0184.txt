For they osten go to sup with them, and even, sometimes, when they are not

invited.

What can 1 reply to such unheard os impudence ?

DAMIS.

Even that which 1 have long wished to hear from you ; what reason you
have for thinking that there is a divine providence.

TIMOCLES.

That order and harmony of things, which is universal, first persuaded me
os it : the sun and rnoon holding the same unvaried course, the return of the·
seasons, the generation of plants and animals, the creatures themselves, form-
ed with so much art, and taught to seed, move, think, walk, build, to per‘
form, in short, every thing that is necessary and convenient for thern ; these
Ι take to be the works of providence,

D A M Ῑ S.

This, Timoeles, is begging the question ; for it is not yet proved whether
all that is the work of providence or not: that such things are, I acknowlege,
bnt it does not therefore follow that I must believe thern to be the effe& of
providence: they may have happened by chance in the beginning, and so
continued. You call that order which is but neceffity; and then are angry ⁷
if any man, observing with you, and admiring, doth not at the same time
acknowlege that to providence they are indebted for their order and regu-
larity ; as the man, therefore, says in the † comedy, this argument is nought,

bring me another.
T Ι Μ O C L E S.

There wanm, l think, no other: however, Iwill ask you. one thing, and:
beg you will answer me3 was not Homer the best of poets?

⁰ To gram] See Home& Iliad, book i. 1.. 55⁶· Lucian is always laughing at Homer fon
sending his gods to AEthiopia.

ξ Comcdv.] What comedy is here alluded to we know not, the passage is not, lbelieve,
to be found in any now extant.
