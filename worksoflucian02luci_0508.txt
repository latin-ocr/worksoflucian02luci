were to be employed both for the defence of the queen, and in the con-
struction of the edifice. The king had, at this time, amongst his particu-
lar famurstes, a youth of extraordinary beauty, whose name was Communis,
whom he called in on this occasion, and thus addreffed: “ Combabus,
(said he‚) l have always looked upon you as one of the best· of men, and
rankcd you amongst my dearest friends, both on account of your prudence
and discretim, and the particular kindness and regard which you have sslewn
for me: 1 now stand in need of a man whom I can safely confide in; and
therefore appoint you to accompany my wife, to perform the great and sa-
cred work, and to take the command of my army. When you return, I
shall reward you with the honours which you deserve.'’ When Combabus
heard this from the king, he most earnestly entreated him that he might be
excused from taking upon him a rask to which he was so unequal :he was, in-
deed, not without fears, that somejealousy might afterwards arise with regard
to Stratonice, whom he, and he alone, was to accompany. Not being able,
however, to diffunde the king from his resolution, he again petitioned that
he might be allowed seven days respite; after which he would depart, and

thatl am, (cried he 3) why must this trust be reposed iu me? what must be
the end of such a journey, young as I am, to accompany so beautiful a wo-

of my ruin: I must do one great and noble deed, which will at once free
me from every danger.’' So saying, he immediately cut off the instruments
of virility, and inclofing them in a box, with honey, myrrh, and other
aromatics‚ sealed them up with the ring which he wore on his finger. As
soon as his wounds were healed, and he thought himself able to 'perform the
journey, he came to the king, and, in the presence of many persons, hold-
ing the box in his hand, thus addreffed him : “ This great and invaluable
treasure, hitherto deposited in my own house, as 1 am now going a long
and dangerons journey, 1 here deliver, fir, to your care; preserve it,
O king, for it is to me more precious than gold, and dearer than my
own life : when I return, I {hall hope to receive it safe from your
hands.'’ The king immediately took, and sealing it with another ring,
gave it to his officers, with orders to take especial care of it. Comba·
bus then sat out on his journey with great security: as soon as they
