number of credulous boys, roar to them in a tragica} style about virtue,
and enter into disputations'that are endless and unprofitable. To their dis-
ciples they cry up fortitude and temperance‚ a contempt of riches and plea-
sures, and, when alone, indulge in riot and debauchery. The most into-
lerable of all is, that though they contribute nothing towards the good and

welfare of the community, though they are
