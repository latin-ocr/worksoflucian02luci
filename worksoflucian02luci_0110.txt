he had by chance discovered the affair, or it had been so concerted between
them (for the story is differently told), on a sudden sprang out of some pri-
vate place, ordered the doors to be shut, and Dinias to be seized on; draw-
ing his sword on the adventurer, and threatening to beat him, or throw him
into the fire. Dinias‚ perceiving what a wretched situation he was in,
snatched up a bar that lay by him, and striking Demonax on the temples,
ssew him, then turning to Chariclen, first with the bar, and afterwards with
the sword of Demonax, repeating his blows, made an end of her ι the ser·
vants‚ who scemed struck dumb with an event so unexpeeled‚ endeavoured
to lay hold on him, but, hepursuingthem sword in hand, they retired. Di-
nias got offas privately as hc could, and stayed with Agathocles till morn-
ing, deliberating on what it was best to do on this occafiom the magistrates
having intelligence (sor the thing was now become public), came early,
seized upon Uinius, who did nor dcny the fast, and carried him before the
governor of Afia, xx ho sent him to the emperor: a little while after he wax
transported to *ἓ Gya-rim, one of the Cyclades, being contffinned by the em·
perot to perpetual banishment. Agathocles alone, of all his friends, accom-
panied him into Italy, attended him to the tribunal, and affisted him in every

thing: neither, when he went into banifhrnent‚ did this faithful friend de-
sert him, but, condemning himself to voluntary exile, remained with him

in Gyarus, and when he became so poor as to want common neceffaries,

hired himself to one of those who dive for the *Γ purple-fifh, and with the .

wages he received supported Dinias‚ took care of him during a long illness‚
and even after his death would not return to his own country, but stayed in
the issand, as ifto guard the remains of his departed friend. This is 3 very

recent example, as I believe it is scarce five years ago fince Agathocles died
there.

1 nish‘, Mnesippu5‚ you had told this story without swearing to it, as Ῑ
might then have called the truth of it in question: this Agathocles was

really quite 3 Scythian friend. Iam afraid you will be puzzled to find

such another.
