355 ONCALUMNY.

this, no doubt, of all human injuries3 as the best lawgivers, Solon'and Draco,
long since acknowleged it, who bound thejudges by a solemn oath, to hear
both parties with equal patience, till the cause was fully determined, and it
plainly appeared, which was the worse, and which the better part : they
ever held thara profane and impious judgment, Which was made before the
defence had been fairly opposed to, and compared with the accusation. If
we permit the accuser to say what he pleases without sear, and shut our ears
against the defendant, or, over-persuaded by what hath been alleged against,
filently condemn him, the gods, themselves, will resent your injustice and
inhumanity; itis, therefore, neitherjust nor lawful to calumniate.

But, if the legissators who thus prescribe justice and impartiality‚ are not of*
sufficient weight and authority, let us call in to our aid one of our best ¹* poets,
who hath determined, or rather decreed concerning this point: where he says,

Give not thy judgment e'er thou hear’st what both
May plead in their defence.

He, no doubt, was well convinced, thatof all wicked affions in life, no-
thing could be more unjust or more impious than to condemn any man un-
heard and untried3 which the calumniator is constantly guilty of, by sub-
jecting him whom he ssanders to nnmerited resentment, and by a clandestine
accusation, taking away from him the means of defending himself: for these
kind ospeople, who are always deceitful ancl cowardly, do nothing openly;
but, like those who lye in ambussi, shoot at you at a distance, from some se-
cret place, where you have no power to refist them, but must inevitably perish
for want of knowing their art and manner of fighting. This is. to me a cer-
tain fign, that calumniators accuse, for the most part, without a cause3 for,
if a man knows that what he afferts against any one is true, he will prove it
pnblicly, provoke him to a defence„ and replly to it. He who has reason to
hope for victory in the open field, never makes use of treachery or fraud to
subdue his enemy.

Calumniators are observcd to flouriffi and abound most in the courts of
princes, and in the houses of the rich and grear, where there islalways a
great deal of envy, ten thousand suspicions, and perpetual food for calumny.
and adulation ; v where hopes are multiplied, deffies must be more eager,
hatred more dangemus, and detraction more malevolent3 in such places
