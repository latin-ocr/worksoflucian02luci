526 ENCOMIUM oN DEMOSTHENES.

poffible to corrupt him„ who has spent all his patrimony, either in support
' of the public cause, or in presents to his indigent friends and neighbours;
or can you think him capable of being intimidated‚ who resolved to sacri-
fice his life in the service of his country? Can you be angry at his reflezstions
on yon, when even the Athenians do not escape his censure? He takes care
of the common weal, from the sincere love which he has for it, and confi-
ders his country as a school of philosophy. The opinion of such a man,
Archias, Icould wish to have known, conceining the present state of my
affair53 his wholesome counstls 1 would gladly have listened t0, much rather
than to the croud of ssattcrers which snrround me. I would have 'advised
him, instead of sacrificing his life to those ungratesul Athenians, to rely on
better and more faithful friends. With regard to any thing else, you might
have prevailed on him; but his country he would never have forsaken,
which he loved even to distrafflon.”

“ Ι believe so, said Antipater3 but how did he die .³'' “ That, answered
Archias, will raise your astonishment more than any thing else: we, who
were eye—witneffes‚ wereamazed at it. His death, from the preparation he
had made for it, seemed to be a matter long since determined : he sat in the
innei· part of the temple, wherel conversed with him for several days, but
to no purpose.'’ ‘⁶ And what, said Antipater, was the subjeft of your dis-
course ?” ‘⁶ Your humanity‚ replied Archias, and design of pardoning him;
not that l knew this was your intention, for Ι 1)ε1ἰενε.ό you were greatly ex-
asperated against him: but l thought it right to make him believe you
would.'’ “ W'onld I had been there myself, said Antipater, to have heard
what paffed l but tell me every thing3 it is no little satisfadffion to know the
sentiments and behaviour of a great man in the hour of death: what said he
to the offer? was he weak and cowardly, or did he retain his firmness and
constancy to the 121st ?'’ ‘⁶ He did, said Archias; with a pleafing smile on *
his countenance, rallied me on my past life, said Ι was a bad εξὶοτ, and re-
peated your falsehoods most milex-ablyf' “ And did he, said Antipater,
destroy himself, rather than trust to my promises ?'' “ Not so, replied Ar-
chias3 it was not you alone (since you must know ali), whom he distrusted:
‘⁴ There is nothing,said he, so wicked which 1 cannot believe ofa Macedonian,
nor is it wonderful they should wilh to take Demosthenes, as they have al·
ready taken Amphipolis, Olynthus, and Oropus.’' Much more he then spake
to the same purpose; sor Ι took down, by a notary, all he said, that I might
