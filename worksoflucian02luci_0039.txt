ONDANCING. 33

turning their heads towards the east, salute him with a dance; silenrly
throwing themselves into certain postures, and imitating the motions of the
divinity. Such is the adoration of the Indians, their chorus, and sacri-
fice3 in this manner they propitiare the deity in the morning and in the even-
ing every day. The AEthiopians also dance whilst they fight; nor will one
of them take an arrow out of his hair, (for that is his quiver, which they
surround like so many rays,) without first making nse of several threatening
motions, and terrifying the enemy with a dance.

And now we are got into India and AEthiopia, it may be worth our while
to' step down into the neighbouring kingdom of AEgypt. Here, according
to the old fable, lived the famous Proteus, who, 1 believe, was nothing
more than a good dancer, and an excellent mimic3 who could throw him-
selfinto all shapes and forms, imitating‚ by the rapidity of his morioris, the
swiftness of fire, the fluidity of water, the fierceness of the lion, the spirit
of the panther, the bending of the treeS, and any thing, in short, he pleased:

but they caught hold of the marvellous, and told the story as if those things
had really happened, which were so well represented by him, though those
that dance now perform the very same, for they change themselves into every
form, and rival ‘t Proteus himself: we have reason to suppose that Empusa
also, who could throw herself into such a variety of ssrapes, was likewise

some excellent proficient in this art.
Nor must we here pass over that dance of the Romans which is performed

by the *1* Salii (for so they call some of their priests), in honour ofMars, the

god of war, and which is most grave and holy.
Agreeable to this Roman custom is the fable which the Bithyniam· relate

of their Priapus, a warlike deity, one of the Titans I believe, or the ζ Idae-

ἃ Proteu5.] Here the mask falls fairly off, and Lucian may be said to laugh out: his turning
Proteus into a dancing-master plainly shews he cannot be ingearnest, but it is hoped the Proteus's
of the present age, in consideration of the many handsome things he has said on the subject,
will forgive him a laugh or two on the profession.

ἦ· Salii] The Salii were Roman priests, and so called from salio, to dance, first appointed
we are told by Numa : their office was ro celebrate the rites of Mars with sougs and dances ;
they were habited in ashort scarlet caffuck, having round them a broad belt‚ clasped with
brass buckles‚ on their heads they wore a sort ot' copper helmet, {hort swords by their fides, a
javelin in their right hand, and the ancele‚ or tanget, in the other. They were twelve in num-
ber, and always chosen from the patriciana.

ζ Idaean dafiyli.] Priests of Cybele, who was worshipped on mount Ida, called dac'tyli, from
δακτυλος, a finger, in allusion ro their number, as in their first institution there were but ten of
thern. See Strabo, Pollux, ls. Casaubon, and the learned Bryan.
