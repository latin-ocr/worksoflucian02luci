TOXARIS. 117

with· us, is looked upon as the strongest mode of supplication. Whoever
” ΡΙέεΐος then comes, takes a part of the flesh, and placing his right foot on
the hide, makes a solemn promise to affist him to the utmost of his abilities:
⁷ one to raise five horsemen with pay and provender, or so many foot ready
armed, some ten, and others more, according to their rank and fortune, and
the poorest offers his own service. A prodigious multitude is sometimes thus
'affembled on the hide, and these armies arc generally firm and invincible,
being all bound by oath; for, to stand upon the hide, is always considered
as the most solemn obligation. In this business Arsacomas was now tieeply
engaged, and had got together about five thousand horse, and oflight-armed,
and other foot, near twenty thousand.

In the mean time, Lonehates made the best of his way privately into Bos-
phorus, and being introduced to the king, who was then bufied in some af„
fairs of the'state, told him, that he 'raras just arrived with a commiffion from
the commonwealth-ofScythia, and had, withal, some matters ofimportance
to communicate to him in secret. Beingdesired' by the king immediately to
acquaint him with them3 ‘³ The Scythians, said he, with regard to the for-
mer part of my embass'y, do, by me, require and infist, that your ssiepherds
will not wander over into their fields, but keep wirnin the Trachon : they
likewise affure you, that the robbers whom you eornplain of for making in-
curfions into your territories, are not authorised by the public, and it you
seize any of them, you may punish ¹them as they deferre: this they re-
quested might be made known to you. l must now, nioreover, acquaint
you, that Arsacomas, who lately came her-e on an embass'y, is now raising a
great army against you] incensed, l believe, at the repulse hemer with,
when he nsked your daughter in marriage. for these seven days past, lie
hath sat on the hide, and has already colleeted together no inconsiderablc
number of! forces.” ‘f I have heard, replied Leucanor, ofsorces raised on
the hide, but did not know before, that they were designed against me, or
that Arsacomas was to be their general.''' ‘⁴ Against you, and you alone,
rejoined Lonchates, the whole expedition is pointed: but, between our—
selves, Arsacomas is my avowed enemy, he cannot bear to see me preferred
before him by the elders of Scythia, 'and in. every thing to be accounted
superior to him. lf, therefore, you' will promise to give me your other
, daughter Barcetis, (and you will find me not unworthy of her,) Iwill under-

take, in a very short time, to bring you the head of Arsacomas,?’ ‘¹- Yon:
