516 ENCOMIUM oN DEMOSTHENES.

rule of proportion, and make the door bigger than the house: to say no
more, therefore, of Athens, let us remember that his father was an admiral,
a title of the highest rank there; and his leaving his son an orphan was no
missortune to him, but rather a happiness, as it gave him the opportunity
of shewing his talents‚ and increased his reputation. Concerning Homer's
education and manners, history gives us no intelligence, nor must we have re-
course to Hefiod's laurel, that inspired the shepherds, and made them all
poets; but in the praise of Demosthenes you may call in the testimony of
Callistratus, Alcicfflmus, Isocrates, Isaeus, Eubatides, and a long list of
learned names to asfist you. You may tell υς, that in spite of all the plea-
sures of Athens, in spite of that propensity to vice, which young men are
ever prone to, and though, through his tutor's negligence‚ he might have
given himself up to luxury and extravagance, the love of philosophy and
virtue prevailed over all, and led him, not to the door of ³ Phryne, but to
the schools of Aristode, Theophrastus, Xenocrates, and Plato.

And here, my good friend, you might harangue on the two different kinds
of *l* love that aetuate the human breast3 one vague, liuciuating, wild, and
stormy, raising tumults in the mind, like that Venus of the sea, from whence
it sprang: the other, a link of the great heavenly chain, an image of the
never-sading goddess of beauty, who doth not inflict incurable wounds with
sires and darts, but inspires the soul with a pure and holy flame, that sacred
sury which, as the tragedians say, the gods alone, and those who resemble
them, are endowed with. It was this which enabled the great orator to go
through the 'g grottO, the looking-glas5‚ and the sword3v which taught him
to get over the difficulties of his pronunciation, to despise the multitude, to
continue night and day at his studies, which sharpened his memory‚ and
made him vigilant and industrious: we are not, therefore, surprised to find
Demosthenes so excellent, enriching his orations both with words and senti-
ments, expreffing all the paffions of the mind with such force and spirit,
and with such a variety of figures: he alone, as Leosthenes did not scruple
to affert, could produce a discourse that was at once lively and solid.
