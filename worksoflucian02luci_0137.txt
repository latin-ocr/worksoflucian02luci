of it, they die immediately. The gardener, chancing to spy me out, carne
into the garden, and perceiving what destruetion 1 had made ofhis pot-
herbs, even, just at the -,¹÷ thies-detesting constable lays hold on the culpiit,
seized on, and belaboured me with a large club, sparing neither sides nor
thighs, ssit my ears, and tore my face: Igrew out of all patience, and list-
ing up my heels, laid him flat on the ground, and fied towards the moun-
tain: as he saw me going off, he cried out, and bade them set the dogs at
me; for there were a number of them hard by, very large, fierce, and tit to
fight with bears. 1 concluded that if they laid hold on, they would tear ine
in-piecer„ and deeming it, as they say, better to run backward than not to
run well, Ireturned as fast as l could to the stable: they called off, and ried

What my former resolutions would have brought me to, I determined to bear
my present misfortunes with patience, and to push on boldly, in hopes that

I might one day light on some roses‚ and recover myselfz I heard, besides,
