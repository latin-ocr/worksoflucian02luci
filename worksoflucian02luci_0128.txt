122 TOXARIS.

thing mean or base for a subfistence; but Sifinnes begged 1 would, on no ac-
count, do any such thing3 and endeavoured to console me, by saying, he
had thought on a method to procure vietuals for us. He hired himself as a
portes, to carry wood from the harbour, aud with the money bought us
some provifion. Next morning, as he was walking in the forum, he saw a
proceffion of well-made, noble, youths; these, he understood, were to
fight as gladiators for a confiderable surn of money in three days after. As
soon as he had learned this, he came to me, and said, “ Toxaris, no longer
complain of being poor, for in three days timeI will make you rich.'' Dur—
ing the interval, we made what shift we could to live, and the appointed
time sor this spectacle now approaching, we resorted to it. He had led me
there, indeed, as to a Grecian sight, which had something new and extraor-
dinary in it. We sat down in the theatre, and first saw several wild beasts
hunted by (loge, wounded with spears, and then set on to fight with some
men, who we supposed were malefactors: the gladiators then came on the
stage, and the crier bringing on a tall lusty youth, proclaimed, that if any
man would sight with him, he ssrould come forth, and as a reward, he should
receive ten thousand drachmas. Upon this, Sifinnes got up, and leaping
into the middle of the theatre, declared himself ready to fignt, demanded
the arms, and receiving the money, brought it to me; “ Toxaris, said he,
if l conquer‚ we ssiall have enough to live on, and will go away together;
if 1 fall, you will bury me, and return to Scythia.” He then took the arms,
and put on every thing but the helmet, choofing to fight with his head bare.
At the first onset he was dreadfully wounded, having his knee cut with a
hookcd sword, and bleeding plentifully. I perceived it, and was almost
dead with fear. He rushed, however, on his adversary, whom he observed
coming on with great impetuosity, and struck him on the breast with such
force, that he fell down at his feet. Sifinnes was, himself, so weak with
the wound he had received, that he almost fainted as he stood over his dead
foe, and seemedjust expiring. Ι ran to, raised up, and comforted hirn;
as soon as he was declared conqueror, I took him in my arms, and carried him
home with me. By degrees, with great care, he at length recovered, and is
now in Scythia& having married my sister, though he is ‘ssiu lame of the
vconnd.
