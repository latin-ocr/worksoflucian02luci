that things fall out, οι· vary, according to their necessary rotation. Otherz
acknowlege the truth, but not the utility of the art3 affirming‚ that nothing
could be changed by divinadon, which was already decreed by fate.

To these objections Ι can only answer, that the stass perform their own ro-
tations in the heavens, and at the same time perhaps, together with their
own motions, may direci: ours. When the horse runs, and men and birds
move, the stones are loosened, and the stubbvle is blown about by the wind;
and shall nothing be effeeted by the motion of the stass? from the smallest
fire, some heat comes to us, though the fire bunis not on our account, nor seem-
eth to care whether we are warm or not; and ssmll we not feel and acknowlege
the influe-nce of the stass? It is nor, indeed, in the power of astmlogy, to
make things better than they are, or to change them from what they were:
it is, nevertheless, profitable to those who make use of it, for, when good
events are foretold, it anticipates the pleasure of thern ; and reaches us to bear
evils withthe greater patience, as they do not corne upon us so unexpec‘tedly,
but become foster, and more tolerab1e‚ by our fore-knowlege of them.

Such are my sentiments, concerning astrology.
