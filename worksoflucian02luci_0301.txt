MOURNING FOR THE DEAD.

In this little Τναξῗ Lucum laughs at the whole Story of the Pagan Hell, as related
by the Poets, and believed by the Multitude; together with many of the ridiculam
Customs and Ceremonies used at Funerals, by People of all Nations. Ίλτνε are
firme good strokes of Humour in several Parts of it.

T is well worthy of our observation to remark what strange things the

generality of mankind do and say with regard to [ηοω-γύης, both those
who suffer, and those who condole, how dreadful and lamentable every thing
appears, though, by Pluto and Proserpine, I believe none of them really know
whether what happens is the better or the worse, for those whom they thus
pity and lament : but they grieve according to stated modes and forms, and
when a man dies, thus they always adst. Ι would first examine, therefore,
what their opinion concerning death is, so will all the superfluous pomp and
parade attending it be best accounted for.

The great multitude, whom the wife and learned call the mobility, who
have an implicit saith in Homer, Hefiod, and other fabulous writers, be·
lieve that there is beneath the earth, a place called Hades, or Hell, dec-p,
dark, and spacious, where ‘the sun never enters, and yet, we know not how,
so 4 enlightened, as that all things in it may be fairly seen. In this cavern
reigns the brother of Jupiter, surnamed Pluto, (for so I was informed by
one skilled in those matters), and so called, because lie is ψ rich in dead mem
here he lives, and gives laws to his own kingdom, for to him, it seems, was
allotted the empire of the dead, whom he holds in indiffoluble chains, never
permitting them to return to earth, but on some particular occasions, and
which have very seldorn happened from the earliest period of time to this
day : the whole region is surrounded by rivers, which excite terror by their
very names, such as ᾗ· Cocytus, Periphlegcthon‚ and the rest of them; then

⁵⁸ Enlfghtened] What Milton in his description of hell poetically calls ’ί Darkness vilible.’⁹
† Rich] A play upon the word Ihm-05, or Pluto, in Greek fignifying rich.

’ᾗ Cocytus] From Κωκυτος, lamentation. ι
