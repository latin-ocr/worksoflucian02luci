who waited: they looked upon all this as very unaccountable, little suspect-

ignomnce, to fare most delicioussy. I learned to go upon two legs, and to
carry my master so easily, that he scarcc knew 1 was under him : for all this

I was rewarded with magnificent furniture‚ purple housmgs, bridles worked
with gold and silver‚ and bells that made the sweetest harmony.

Menecles, for that was my new master’s name, had come from Thessalo-
nica, to procure a shew of gladiators, which he had promised to bring back
with him, and the rnen being now ready, we all set out, early in the morn-
