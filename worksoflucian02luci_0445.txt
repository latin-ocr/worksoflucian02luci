ΟΝ τ-ΗΕ DEATH οι·- PEREGRINUS. 439

himself, (·’Α if ever he was burned at alh) on account os the dreadful disordcr
which he laboured under, when 116 was tormented, as the tragedy tells us,
by the blood of the centaur: but what reason had Proteus to throw himself ⁵
into the fite? only, Ι suppose, to shew his fortitude, and that he might
resemble the ψ Brachmans. These his friend Theagenes compared him to,
by way of excuse; as if men might not be foolish and vain-glorious in
India as well as any where else: but these he did not imitate; for they, as
Onesicritus, Alexander’s tutor, who saw Calanus burning, informs urz, do
not jump into the fire, but, building up a funeral pile, and standing close
to it, suffer themselves to be scorched without stirring‚ then lay quietly down
upon it, and never change their posture: but what very great thing was it
for our hero to leap into the fire, and be consumed immediately ? Ι should
not, indeed, have been surprised to hear, that, when he was half burned,
he had leaped back again, if he had not, as they said he did, built the pile
in a deep ditch. We were told by some, that he had changed his mind,
and gave out (a mere invention of his own), that Jupiter would not suffer a
place so sacred to be polluted3 but, with regard to that, he might make
himself easy, for I would venture to swear, that none of the gods would
be angi-y at hearing that Peregrinus had destroyed himself. But it was im-
poffible for him to retreat; the wretches who accompanied him, took care
to egg him on, to animate his resolution, and prevent his receding from it
through sear: if he had dragged in two or three of these along with him,
he would have done, at least, 0116 good office. He meant, 1 hear, no longer
to be called Proteus, but to take upon him the name of Phoenix, because
the Indian bird so called builds its own funeral pile, and, when it arrives
at the extremity of old age, burns itself: he had, likewise, spread it abroa'ch
and brought forth some old oracles to prove it was decreed by the Fates, that
he should appear as the guardian deity of the night. It is plain his ambi-
tion was to have altars 61681661 to, and statues made of him : for my own
part, Ι make not the least doubt, but, amongst the croud of madmen that

cules, after he had put on the envenomed shirt, ran mad, made a funeral pile, and threw him-
self upon it, defiring his friend Phi10&etes to take care of his ashes. See the Trachinioeof So-
phocleS, where the story is told at large3 though, perhaps, as Lucian intimates‚ it was nothing

more than a poetical tale.
