delivered every day, or to every body, but only to such as were well-dressed,
very rich, and couzd pay well for them.

Of this kind was the answer given to Severian, on his entrance into Arme-
nia, when, exhorting him to the enterprize, the oracle spake thus ε

Armenia low beneath thy conqn’ring spear,
And Parthia fall’n, to Tiber’s limpid stream,
And happy Rome, with rays of laurel crown’d
Shalt thou return.

, And when the foolish Gaul was thus prevailed on to make the invasmn,
and failed in the attempt, being ssain together with all his forces by Othrya-
des ; he erased that oracle from the records, and substituted in its place the
following verses ι

Against Armenia lead not forth thy pow’rs,
Lest from a foe in female garb array’d
A fatal arrow sent, deprive thee soon

Of light and life.

For it was one of his most excellent contrivances tomake oracles after the
event, to save the cred-it of those that had miscarried. He would often pro-
mise health, and if the person died, another- oracle was soon ready, that said,

Seek not a cure, for know thy fate is· nigh,
Nor can’st thou 'scape it.

Well‘knowing that the Clarians, Mallians, and Didymaeans were famous
for the farne art of prophesying3 he made friends of them, sending away
many of those who came to hin] with appeals to thern: to one he said,

To Claros haste, and hear my father’s voice.
To another,

‚Go to the Branchi'dae, and there consuIt
The oracle.

And to a third,
To Mallos hence, and hear ³¹⁵ Amphilochus.

⁰ Amphilochus] The oracle of Amphilochus was of one of the longest-lived religious itu-2

postors of antiquity. Dion C. speaks of it as in a flourishing state, even so late as in the reign-
οῖ Constantius, the father of Constantine the Great.

Such.
