It was a good observation, I think, ofthe ⁴ comic poet, that no injury is
done, where none is felt: and what great hannis it if a few men go away

ἦ· Zopyrus] Darius, we are told, owed the kingdom of Babylon to the contrivance of this
ingenious gentleman3 who, at the fiege of that city⁷ having ssit his own nese, cut off his ears,
and mangled his body in various parts, presented himself in that condition to the Babylonians;
complained to them of Darius’s crue-Ity, which had reduced him to that dreadful state, and
vowed revenge against him. The Babylonians were taken in, entrusted him with the command
of their army, which, in consequence of a pre-concerted scheme between him and Darius, he
betrayed tothat monarch, and put him in poffeffion of Babylon. Darius, after the conquest, is
reported by Herodotus, to have said, that “ he would rather wilh to see Zopyrus safe, uuhurr‚
and unmaimed‚ than to acquire twenty more Babylohs besides that which he had already sub-
dued.” These are the words of Herodotus, which Jupiter here applies; but, as the reader
may observe, with a little variatim, to his friend Darnis. The account of this transaction told
at large, may be found at the end of the third book, or Thalia, of Herodotus.
