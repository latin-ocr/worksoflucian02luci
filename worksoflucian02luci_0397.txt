ENCOMIUM ONAHOUSE. 391

merit of his oration did not answer to the dignity of the subje&; his faults
would then be but the more conspicuous: like a man in beautiful armour
flying before the enemy, whose cowardice, on that very account, would be
more taken notice of. This ²* Homer’s great orator seemed convinced of,
who attended not in the least to externa] beauty, but even assumed the cha-
τεξῒεῑ of the most ignorant and unskilful of men, that what he said might
appear more worthy of admiration. The speaker, moreover, cannot hirn-
self refrain from admiring the spe&acle, which must prevent his attention to
the discourse3 and when thus employed, how can it otherwise happen, but
that he must speak the worse for it! I need not add, that in a house like this,
the company is more generally inclined to see than to hear τ not a Demodo-
cus, a Phemius, or a Thamyris, no, nor even an Orpheus or Amphion,
would have eloquence enough to draw afide their attention to the spectacle,
nor surrounded by such beauty‚ would one of them listen to the speech, but
continue gazing at the sight 3 unless he chanced to be blind, or the affembly
met ar night, like the council of ἢν Areopagus. How much superior fine
objects are to fine words, the fable of the Syrens and Gorgons sufficiently
points out to us3 the Syrens, we knOW‚ by their sweet songs, detained many,
and stopped their journey, some, however, sailed by, and never listened to
them 3 but the beauty of the Gorgons was so exquisite, that it took poffeffion
of the soul, struck the beholders dumb, and bereaved them of their
senses; the fable even tells us they were turned into stone. What your first
orator said about the peacock, certainly favours my argument, and not his,
for it is his appearance, and not his voice, that delights us3 and if you
were to get a swan or a nightingale to fing whilst he was present, the
attention would be fixed on him, and nobody would mind the music: so su—
perior is that pleasure which ariserh from the sight to every other.

ButI will bring a witness, and a most respectable one, who shall bear

“ Homer's, Εὔα] Ulyffes.

† A›·copagus.] It is remarkable that in the Areopagus, or grand Athenian court ofjustice,
the judges heard and determined all causes at night, and in the dark, to the end, says Portet,
that having neither seen the plaintiff nor defendant, they might lay under no temptation os be-
ing biassed or influenced by them. Though the cussom is whimfical, there is something right
in the cause here affigned for it. By the same method of reasoning, a modern justice of peace
should be blind. These, however, amongst ue, who are acquainted with the true charafier of
the present Sir John Fielding, have a much better reason than this for adrniring him, as
they will not perhaps, find in any other magistrate, ancient or modern, an equal degree of

penetration and sagacity‚ joined to so much honour and integrity‚
