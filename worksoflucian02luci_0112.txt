overboard, the other leaped in after him, and that they swam some time ε
it was dark and he could see no more, Euthydieus himself tells the rest, and
informs us that they first got on some pieces of cork, which kept thern up

with difficulty for a few hours, and that in the morning they spied the lad-
der, which they got upon, and carne safely to Zacynthus.

After these two instances, which are no bad ones, 1 ffiall now produce a
third. not less remarkable.

Eudamidas, of Corinth, who was himself very poor, had two rich friends„
Aretaeus, a Corinthian, and Charixenus, a Sicyonian : when he died he left a
will, which to many may perhaps appear ridiculous3 though to a good man,
like yourself‚ who knows the merit of friendffiip, and is now contending for
the noblest example of it, it cannot poffibly appear so : in this will was the
following article, “ Ileave to Aretaeus the care of nourishing and providing
for my mother in her old age, and to Charixenus the portioning out of my
daughter, which he will do to the best of his abilities ;'' for he had at that
time a mother who was very old, and a daughter marriageable z “ If either
of these, it went on, should happen to die, the other is to perform the part
of the person so dying, as well as his own.’' The will being opened, in the
presence of some who were acquainted with the poverty of Eudamidas, but
not with the fincerity of his friends, they turned it into ridicule3 how happy,
said they, laughing, will Aretaeus and Charixenus be, and what a noble
legacy will they receive, when they are to pay for Eu-damidas, and whilst
living themselves, have a dead man to inherit their estates ! The heirS, not-
withstanding, to whom it was bequeathed, as soon as they heard the contents
of the will, resolved to execute it according to his defire: Chwixenus, how-
ever, died himself within five days after, but Aretaeus, the best heir, per·
haps, that ever lived, most nobly performed the part of both, for he took
care of the mother, and not long ago gave the daughter a portion, and out
offive talents, which were all he was worth, gave two to the daughter of
his friend, and two to his own; and they were both married the same day.

&Vhat think you, Toxaris, of this Aretaeu53 was it not a noble instance of

affeffion, to pay such a regard to the will of his friend, will you allow this -
to be one of the five?

TOXARIS.

He is, indeed, an excellent example; but I admire Eudamidas still
more, for ihe confidenee which he placed in his friends: it isaproof that he
