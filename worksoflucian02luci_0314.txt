308 THE COMPLETE ORATOR.

a book in your hand. All this you must provide yourself with; and as for
the rest, as we go along, Ι will explain every thing to you, and lay down
some rules, which, if you carefully observe, oratory ssiall not reject you as
one who hath never been initiated into her mysteries, but with open arms
receive and embrace you. And first, remember that your dress and appear-
ance are decent and handsome3 theu get you fifteen or twenty good Attic
words, well seleeted, and maturely considered of, which you must have al·
ways ready, and at your tongue’s end, such as ἕξ atta, and kata, and mone,
and ameegete, and lowste, and so forth3 these you must sprinkle over every dis-
course‚ like so many sweetmeats, and never mind, if the rest of your words
arc ever so unlike thern, barth, and dissonant, and of quite another class.
Let your garb be as coarse as you please, so that the purple be fine, and full
of flowers. In the other parts of your speech, your words may be strange,
obsolete, and such as are seldom met with amongst the ancients; these you
must have ready to throw at every body who converses with you z the vulgar
will admire you, and think you a wonderful man, whose learning is above
their † comprehenfion.

“ If, after all, you blunder upon solecisms and barbarisms, there is one iu-
fallible remedy for you, which is impudence ; you have nothing to do but
immediately to quote some poet or prose-writer, no matter whether there
ever was such a person, who approves that mode of speech, and who was a
most learned man, and an excellent judge of language. As to study‚
you must never read the ancients, the trifler i Isocrates, the awkward
ungraceful Demosthenes, or the frigid Plat03 but consult the books
lately publistied‚ what we call our declamations; from these you may guther
instructions, use thern whenever you have occasion, and take, as from a
flore-house, whatever you want out of them.

“ If you are to speak on any point, and the persons present are for suggesting
arguments to yon, and furnishing you with matter, treat them with con-

''‘ Atra, ἱείκ] Greek words frequently used by some of the best Attic writers, and which,
therefore, ‘the ri'diculous imitators of them were perpetually making use of, and applying, right
or wrong, in their own works.

ἡ· Comprchenston.] Here Lucian quotes two or three quaint words and phrases, used at that

time by the literary coxcombs of the age, which, as the learned reader who well knows them,
will eafily perceive, are urntranssatable.
