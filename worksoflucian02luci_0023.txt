THEFALSEPROPHE'n ἠ

'name‘ was Rutilia, the wife of one belonging to Caesar’s household, person-
ating the Moon, came down from the cieling', as if just descended from
heaven, and, in 'the face of the poor husband, most cordially embraced the
prophet (for they were known to be fond of each other), and, if it had not
been for the number of torches, might probably have been still more slmi-
liar with him: a little while after he came in again with great pomp, clad as
high-priest‚ and commanding filence, cried out, HailGlycon! and at the
same time some fellows from Paphlagonia, with clouted ssioeS‚ who stunk
horribly of garlick, aeted the ᾗ Eumolpidae and Ceryccs, and roared out,
Hail Alexander! V

In the mystic dances, by romb-light, he would frequently, and on pur-
pose, shew his naked thigh, which appeared like gold, and which, probably,
he had contrived by means of some ss<in put over it that was gilded, and by
help of the lights ssmne very bright: a dispute arose one day upon this be·—
tween >two fage philosophers‚ “ Whether Alexander had not the foul of
Pythagoras] as well as his golden thigh, or anothei¹ which nearly‘resemss
bled it; and referring the question to Alexainder' himself, the'roya'l Glycon
decided it immediately by this oracle,

Pythagoras oft dies, and oft to life
Again returns; not so the prophet-'s foul,
Which sprang from Jove, by his almighty fire
Cominiffion'd‘to relieve the just and good,
He came on earth, and when the lightning's blast
Shall hurl hirn hence, he must to Jove ἡ* return,

To such a height of pride and debauchery did he at last arrive, that scarce
any woman whom he admired could escape him : the huibands thought it
an honour if he would condescend to kiss their wives, and looked upon it as
a piece of good fortune if he would admit thern into 'nis house 3 many even
boasted of having had children by him, and their spouses complaisantly bore
witness to the truth of it.
'² Eumolpidae] Chief priests of Ceres, a dignity which they enjoyed by hereditary right,
conferred on them by the Athenians, as descendants of Eumolpus z as the mock mysteries of

Alexander were defigned by him as an imitation of the great Eleufinian rites, it was very pro-
per he should be furnissied with all neceffary appurtenances for the performance ofthem.
