ONDANCING. *31⁵

muse-like manner, fought by number5‚ mufic, and a regular motion of the
feet; the pipe always giving the first fignal of battle: and as they were
led on by mufic and dancing‚ they always conquered ε their young men were
taught to dance, as well as to fight : they came to blows, then pansed for a
time, and finished the engagement in a dance3 the fidler always fitting in the
⁴midst‚ and beating time with his foot3 whilst they, forming themselves as it
were, into mette, followed each other in various circumvolutions 3 and
marching to different tunes, sometimes rough and warlike, and soon after to
quick and spritely ones, such as Bacchus and Venus admire. The song
which they fing in their dance, is an invitation to Venus and Cupid to trip it
along with them3 another, forthey sing two, contains instmt‘tions how they
are to dance : then they cry out aloud‚ “ Boys, move your feet, and dance
better.''

Thosedo much the same who perform the ᾗ Hormus: this is a dance of
the youths and virgins, moving in a chorus one by one, like a chain οι· col-
lar, from which it takes its name. The young man leads the way, ssepping
grace-fully along, and with such motions as he is afterwards to praetise jn the
field·, the virgin follows, teaching her seX, as it were, to dance with decen-
cy and grace3 so that the whole appears indeed like a chain, where manly
fortitude, and female modesty, are knit together.

What Homer tells us in his shield of Achilles concerning Γ Ariadne, and
the dance which Daedalus led her, as unneceffary to repeat to a reader like
you, I shall pass over3 as well as the two dancers, leaders of the chorus,
whom the poet calls ³‘- tumblers; and likewise where he says, .

⁸ Hermus] From the Greek ὅρμος, monile, a collar, or necklace. The idea is a pretty one,
something similar to this is frequently adopted in our modern dantes.

† Arladne.] A figured dance succeeds3 such once was seen,
In lofty Gnossus, for the Cretan queen,
Form’d by Daedalian art ; a comely band
Ofyouths and maidens, bounding hand in hand,
Now forth at once⁷ too swift for sight they spring,
And, undistinguifh'd, blend the flying ring.
See Pope's Homer's Odyssey, book xviii. l. (tor.
-l't is worth observing, says a commentator on this passage, that the Grecian dance is still per-
formed in this manner in the oriental natione-3 the youths and maids dance in a ring, beginning
llowly, by degrees the music plays a quicker time, till at last they dance with the utmost 1‘wit‘tne1'5‚
and towards the conclusion, fingas here in a general chorus.
