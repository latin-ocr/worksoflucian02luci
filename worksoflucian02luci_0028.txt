ω ALEXANDER-goxss,

Thir² was owing to his being-deceived by my boy, whom he asked what he
(ηψπ sor, ω which he rcplied, to be cured of a pain in his fide: the other
ansus cr which he gave, took its rise from a question that was proposed to him,
κ thther it was better to go by sea to Italy or on foot ?· 'Ehis made him
say to nie--thch had nothing to do with Homer),

Go not by sea, but take thy way on soor.

I played him several tricks of this kind: for instance, 1 proposed one
question only, and wrote it in a book as usual, and with it sent eightdrachmas,
as isI had paid for so many oracles: he was deceived by this, and to that

know, brought two soldiers with me, sent by my friend the governor of
Cappadocia, to condu& me to the sea,) he received me with the greatest ap·-
pearance of politeness and civility. Ι went to him with my guard, who by
good fortune *had accompanied me thither. He put forth his hand to me
to kiss, as his custom was with the common people3 upon which, stooping

The attendants began to fall upon and beat me, as a profane sacrilegious
wretch‚ being already not a little provoked that I had styled him plain Alex-
