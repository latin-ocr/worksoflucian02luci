JUPITERCONFUTED. 153

U P I T E R.
You must remember, Aliollo had reason to be affronted at Croesus, for try-
ing his oracle by ³¹⁶ mixiug tortoise and larnb's flcsh.

C Y N I S C U S.

A god, Jupiter, should never be angry3 but that the king of Lydia
should be deceived hyan oracle, was, I suppose, decreed by Fure, which
had wove his thread in such a manner, that he could not clearly understand
the prophecy3 so that your power of divination itself‚ is, after all, nomn-‚g

but the work of Fate.
- J U P 1 T E R.

By and by you will leave us nothing: we are gods, it seeme, to very little
purpose, for we take no care ofhuman affairs, nor have any claim ro sacrifice,
being no more, in reality, than so many axes and hammers: bur 1 deservo
all this contempt for standing thus with a thunder—bolt in my hand, aud not
punissiing your insolence.

C Y N Ι S C U S.

Strike, Ibeseech y0u3 if it be so decreed, 1 {hall not blame you for the

blow, but Clotho, who, by you, thus makes an end of me. But let rne ask

you and Fate one more question, and answer nie for both: how happens it
that, taking no notice of thieves, ruffians, and murtherers, you throw your
thunder at oaks, and stones, the mast ofa fhip, that never did any barm, or

now and then a poor innocent traveller! what say you, Jupiter? is this
another thing which I must not enquire after?
J U P 1 T E R.

Itis, you are impioussy inquifitive; Iwonder where you picked up all this
stuffto perplex me with.

’κ’ Mixing, δα] Croesus, who, we may suppose, was a sceptic, or free-ffiinker, with re-
gard to eracles, sent meffengers to Delphos and other places, requesting them to resolve this
question, viz. “ What is Croesus, king of Lydia, now doing ?'’ The answer from Delphos
was, ‘⁴ Ι smell a strong smell ofa tortoise mixed with lamb’s flesh, boiled in a cauldron, that is
brass above and brass* below.” Croesus, it seems, little thinking that the oracle could discover
what he was about, was at that very instant diverting himself with boiling lamb’s flesti and tor-
toise in a brazen vessel. How the oracle, or the priests belonging ro it, got intelligence of hic
majesty‘s strange ernployment at that time, has never yet been discovered; certain, however,
it is that Croesus, from that time, conceived a high opinion οῖ’ the oracle, and consulted it ever
after: but Apollo, we find, resemed the trick which Croesus wanted to play upon him, and
punissied hirn accordingly. See Herodotus's account υἱ thia nmnlrcnm„
