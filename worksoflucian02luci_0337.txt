THE L I A R S. 33¹

“ Well hinted, said Euerates ; now you talk of superstition, what think
you, Tychiades, of oracles, divine intelligence, ancl „hat those who are
aetuated by the deity impart to us, what we hear from the templcs, and
what the virgin crowned with laurels frequently foretells, do you
doubt the truth of these also? Ι shall not mention my ring, with a scal
on it, representing the Pythian Apollo, nor that he converses with inc,
lest 1 should appear to you as a vain master, talking of incredible things;
but 1 will tell you what I heard in the temple of Amphilochus, and
Mallus, and particularly of ancient heroes who have talked with me con-
cerning my affairs: and what 1 have seen at Pergamus and Patari3 for
hearing, whenI returned fron] JEgypt, that Mallus was celebrated for the
truth and clearness of its omeles, and answered word for word to the writ-
ings of the prophet, l resolved to try it, and to consult the god with regard
to futurity.’'

As Eucrates was running on in this manner, Ipereeived how matters
would go, and as he was entering on a long story about oracles, l thought
it was to no purpose for me to stand alone against them all, and so leaving
him in the midst of his voyage from AEgypt to Mallus (for as 1 disputed the
truth of their sables, my company, I found, was not very agreeable)‚ ‘⁴ Ι must
go, said 1, in search of Leondchus, whom I have some particular business
with; as to you, my friends, as things merely human seem not suffi-
cient for you, I would advise you to call in the gods themselves to bear
a part in your fabulous disputations” and so saying I went out and left
them. Theyrseized the opportunity, enjoyed the liberty 1 gave them,
fell to greedily, and swallowed one another’s lies with a most voracious ap-
petite.

Thus have I told you, Philocles, every thing I heard at Euerates’s ε like
those who havejust swelled themselves with new wine, I wanted an emetic,
and have given it you all up again. Ι would give a good deal for an obli-
vious antidote‚ that would make me forget every thing that passed, for I am
afraid the retaining it in my memory will do me no good. Ι have nothing
but miracles, ⁴ witehes and speetres still before me.
