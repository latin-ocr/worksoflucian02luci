wood, cloaths, vessels, and any thing he wants to fit upon, and there he

' remains during the appointed time. The people bring brass‚ gold, and

silver, andlaying them down in his sight, every man tells his name and de-
parts; whilst he puts up his prayers for every one of thern, and whilst he is
thus performing his office, a great shrill noise is made by a brazen instru-
ment, prepared for the purpose. The man never sseeps} if he attempts ir,
a scorpion risos up and stings him: thus at least the priests inform us; but
whether it be so or notI cannot determine; the fear of falling, I should
think, would be sufficient to keep him awake, Thus much sor the climbers
up on the Phalli. The temple looks towards the east, and resembles those
which they usually build in Ionia3 it rises above the ground about twelve
feet, with narrow stone steps up to it : the portico is a most noble sight,
and adorned nith golden gates, theinfide is likewise very rich, and the ciel—
ing fretted with gold. Here you are refreshed with a most delightful odour,
like the sweets of Arabia, which you smell at a great distance3 it persumes
your cloaths‚ and does not evaporate when you leave the place, but remains

The statue of Jupiter is in all respec‘ts like those which we generally meet
with of him: but that of Juno resembles in some particulars those of Mi-
nerva, Venus, the Moon, Rhea, Diana, Nmnefis, and the Parcae; in one
hand she holds a sceptre‚ in the other a distaff; she has rays on her head,
and a turret3 she has likewise a cestus, like the celestial Venus; she is
richly adorned with gold, jewels, and precious stones, some white, others
of a watery colour, others shining, and bright like fire; she has also
onyxes, hyacinths, and smaragdus brought from AEgypt, India, AErhiopia,
Media, Armenia, and Babylon. The most extraordinary among them is a
jewel on her head, which they call the lamp, from its lustre3 by night it
{hines with such a splendour as to light the whole temple3 though in the day
time it is less bright‚ and has the appearance of a pale fise. There is like-
