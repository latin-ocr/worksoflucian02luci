tuous entertainment3 but though he pressed me warmly Ι refused him, keep-
ing myself disengaged‚ like a blockhead as I was, for you, who have de-
serted me to enjoy the company of others; but I am not surprised at it, as
you have not a sufficient comprehenfion of mind todistinguish what is right
and proper3 butI know whom I‘ am indebted to for this treatment, that I
owe it to those admirable philosophers, Zenothemis and the ⁵-¹= Labyrinth,
whom, vanity apart, I could make an end of wi'th a single syllogismi. Lct

of Oeneus: you may recolleet that Diana was highly incensed at him for
not asking her to the sacrifice, when-he invited all the other deities. Ho-

mer speaks thus of it,
-—- ᾗ bade contention rise,
In vengeance of neglee‘ted sacrifice„
