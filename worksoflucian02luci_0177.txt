pretend, therefore, tojput on the modest boy, but, *beardless as you arc,
speak your sentiments boldly3 especially as your son AEsculapius can boast
ofa long heard, and rough chin: it becomes you above all to shew your wis-
dom, who refide in Helicon, and philosophize with the Muses.

A P O L L Ο.
Please, however, Momm, to remember, that it is not you who are to
give me leave, but Jupiter: with his permistion, Ι may poffibly have some-
thing to offer, not unworthy of that Helicon, and those Muses whomI aui

conversant with.

speak, my son, you have free leave.

This * Timocles seems to be an honest man, a lover of the gods, and one
who is well acquainted with the Stoic doctrines. He teaches philosophy to
a number of youths, and, as I am informed, is well paid for it; and yet he
cannot speak well in a large company, has a faltering voice, does not put
his words well together, but stutters, and even when he most wishes to shew
the orator, is a semi-barbarian, and makes the audience laugh at him; not
but he has an excellent understanding‚ thinks deeply, and is thoroughly
versed in all the precepts of his sect, which, when he endeavours to explain
and illustrate, he only confounds, and makes the riddlc but the more ob-
scure by his solution of it: those, therefore, who cannot understand, con-
stantly laugh at hirn. A man should speak clearly, and with †per1}>icuity',
if he expects to be understood.

You give good advice, however, Apollo, and praise that perspicuity in
others, which you never practise yourself; for your oracles are always ob-
scure and perplexed, so that what one Pythian declares, stands in need of

nerva, Ceres, Vulcan, Juno, Mars, Mercury, Diana, Venus, Vesta. Pindar calls them
δωὸικα. avane-sq, the twelve kings. An old poet has put all their names into four hexameter and
pentameter verses, an‘d another, with great ingenusty, crouded them into ΜΟ.

'¹' Timor-lm] Damis and Timocles were, probably, two philosophers, the one a Stoic, the other
nn Epicurean, well known in Lucian's tirne3 who, like the orators ofour lVestminster Forum,
or Apollo Society‚ diverted themselves with public disputes on religione subjeus. Luciau, who
laughs at every thing, takes this opportunity ofproducingthcir characters,and exposing them both.

ἦ» Perspicuily] Fieri potest, says Tully, ut recte quis sentiat δι id quod sentit polite eloqui
11011 possit, sed mandare quenquam literis cogitationes suas, qui eas nec disponere, nec illustrare
poffit‚ nec deleciarione aliqua allicere lectorem, horninis est intemperanter abutentis, δε otio Sc
literis.
