of the world, is the rifing of the sun z for these discoveries the Greeks raised'
him to the throne, ancl his wisdom was held in the highest esteem and' vene·
ration: nearly the same thing, I am inclined to think, happened ro Bellero-
phon z Ι can never bring myself to believe that he had a ’λ’ flying horse, but
fup‘pose he was fond of astrology, engaged in the study of lubli'me know·
lege, and conversam: with the stars3 that he ascended into the heavens, not
by th'e affistance ofa horse, but by the strength of his own mind„ A fable
os the like nature was told of Phryxus, the son of' Athamas, who was car-
ried through the air on a golden ram. The story of »F Daed‘alus, the Athe-
nian, is strange and wonderful ; my opinion is, that it arose from his know-
lege of astrology, which he was well acquainted with, and which he taught
his son: but Icarus, being young and raih, went into abstruse disquifitions,
soared too high, and fell down into the unfathomable abyss ε from hence the
Greeks deduced their fable of the Icarian Gulph.

Pasiphae was most probably told of the fign Taurus in rhe heavens by
Daedalus, and from thence fell in love with Astrology, on which they found-
ed the report of Daedalus having wedded her to a bull‘.

In process of time, the learned divided the talk between· thern; some ap;r

probably took care of' what concerned the Moon ; Phaeton marked out the
progress of the sun, but dying, left the work imperfeeh from whence the
ignorant have invented a strange and' incredible tale of Phaeton's being the
son of Phoebus : that he came to his father the Sun, and begged to drive the
charior for a day ; which was granted him, and rules laid down how he was*
to guide it3 that phaeton, from youth and inexperience‚ drove sometimes
too near the earth, and sometimes too far from it, and killed mortals with⁴
the hear and cold, which were instipportab1e3 that Jupiter being enraged,

ᾗ nging horfia] According to Hyginus, Minerva made Bellerophon a present of Pegasus
(the flying horse here alluded to), to affist him. in his combat with the Chimera. After he
had destroyed that monster, having so good a beast under him, he was for making the

best of-his way up ‘to heaven; but Pegasus, being, unfortunately stung by a horse-Hy,
threw lus rides, who died m the fall.

f Daedalus] This is an excellent burlesque of the story of Daedalus, and plainly {hews that*
Lucian’s defign was, by every possible application, to turn astrology into ridicule. ”
