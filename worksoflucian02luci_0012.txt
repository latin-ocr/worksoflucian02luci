5ALEXANDER;on‚

Alexander, however, proceeded‚ and made his appearance with long
flowing hair, and cloathed in a fine purple robe with white stripes, and a sur-
plice over it, with a scythe in his hand like the figure ofPerseus, from whom,
according to his own account, he was descended. The rascally Paphlago-
nians, though they very well knew that his parents were mean and ignoble,
gave full credit to the oracle, which thus decl-ared,

From Perseus sprung, and to Apollo dear,
Great Alexander comes, the godlike son
Of Podalirius. —-

Podalirius must have been mad after women indeed, to have come from
Tricca quite to Paphlagonia, to meet Alexander’s mother. Another oracle

astonissiing. They had before prepared the head ofa serpent made of linen,
with something like a human form, extremely well painted, and opening and

Ifthe render will take the trouble properly to divide and multiply the numbers, he will find
that the letters together form Αλεξ, Alex. This sufficiently points out the meaningofthepaffage:
any farther explanation would be unneceffary.
