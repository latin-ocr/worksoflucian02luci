APOPHRAS. 335

cover for wickedness and impurity, spare them, Ι bcg, and particularly
your beard ; and when you practise your debaucheries, let it be by night, for
in the day time it is savage, ffioeking, and abominabtc.

You see, my friend, how much better it had been for you not to have
* moved Camarina, roused a sseeping lion, or laugh'd at my Apophras, which
may chance to render your whole life ill-omen'd and detestable. But, per-
haps, you still think 1 might have said more, and I have more at your ser-
vice; as long as it is in my power, you {hall never want your reward; so in-
famous a prostitute as you, should not dare to look up at a man : but you
will say I talk in riddles to you, for you know not halfthe titles which your
vile character has loaded you with: Iwould mention a few of them, but
Apophras is already doubly and trebly revenged of you; you have deserved
it all. And, as the celebrated ψ Euripides says,

Vice, folly, ign’rance, and a ssand’rous tongue,
Still meet at last with bitterness and woe.

⁸ Camarina] A lake near the city of Camarina, in Sicily ; in the time of drought the stench
of this lake produced a pestilence; the inhabitants on this consulted the oracle whether they
thould drain it: the oracle advised them μη naum Καμαρητη, not to remove Camarina, the people
notwithstanding drained the lake, and by that means opened a way for their enemies to come
and plunder their city. Hence the proverb here attuded to, ne moveas camarinam, do not
touch or move Camarina, that is, do not remove one evil to bring on a greater. It has, pretty
nearly at least aa here applied, the same sense as the motto to the Thistle, of, Noli me tangere.
