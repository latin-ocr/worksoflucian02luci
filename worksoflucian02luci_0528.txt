Did he die, then, by the way?

1 suppose, by your neglee‘c in not taking care of him.

A R C H Ι A S.
It was not in our power.
A Ν Τ Ῑ P A T E R.'

How is that ? you talk in riddles3 you took him alive, and yet you have

himnot.
A R C H 1 A S.

Your first commands were, that we should not use violence ; but we were
obliged to it, though it was of no service.

A N T 1 Ρ Α Τ Ε R.
You should not have done it at all: what he suffered from you, Ι sup-

pose, destroyed him. Ἴ
Α R C H Ι A S.

W⁷e did not kill him, though we were compelled to use fome force when
we could not persuade him ι but, after all, what advantage would you have

reaped frorn our bringing him alive ? as you must afterwards, yourself, have

made an end of him.
A N Τ Ι Ρ Α Τ Ε R.

No : Archias, you are a stranger both to his merits and my sentiments: you
seem to think the bringing Demosthenes to me a matter of no more conse-
quence, than if you had discovered those wretches‚ ἦ Phalereus, Aristonicus,
or Eucrates, poor and contemptible creatures, who, like rapid torrents,
swell with popular tumults, and, when the wind subfides, fink, and are no
more ; or the faithless »ᾗ Hyperides, who, to flatter the multitude, blushed
not to calumniare Demosthenes, to please those who were afterwards ashamed
of it, when he returned from banissirnent, like Alcibiades, with redoubled
glmy, whilst Hyperides blushed not to declaim even against his best friend,
with that tongue which deserved to be cut out for its perjury and falsehood.

²¹⁰ Phalereus.] For an account os these, see Plutarch’s Life of Demosthenes.

† Hyperides ] A rival orator, who profess'ed the greatest friendship for Demosthenes, and af»
terminus betrayed and accused him. See Plur. in X. Rhez.
