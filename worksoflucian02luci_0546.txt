horne, what is dear to what is cheap, and every thing that is gained with
difficulty to what may be acquired with ease : you suffer a thousand evils
and niiseries rather than go without what you thirst after3 for many of the

affes, and this you call felicity. Then there are others, who, not content
with taking flessi for food, use it for certain timetures3 as those that make

they were never defigned for ³
