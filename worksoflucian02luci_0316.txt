:10 THECOMPLETE ORATOR„

think before you speak3 sorthat would be a strong argument against you·
Let your friends be always ready torapplaud you with their ἥ fcet; it is what
they owe you sor their suppers; and if at any time they perceive you trip-
ping, ,or hesitating, let them lay hold of your hand and pay you-compli-
mcnts, in the mean time you may find something to say and go on. Be
sure you take care to have a chorus ofyour own to sing with you.

“ This you are to observe with regard to your speeches: after they are
over, let your guard of friends lead you off, converfing with them about your
oration 3 and if you meet any body, bc full of your own praises‚ that you
may appear of some consequence to him, crying out, what is the † I'aeanian
to me, which of the ancients will contend with me? and so forth.

“ But there is one principal thing, and which will raise your reputation
above all, which 1 had forgot to mention3 whoever speaks befides yourself‚
always laugh at them; if they speak well, say they stole it, and it is none
of their own ; if it only tolerable, say it is good for nothing : always come
late into the affembly, and you will be the more taken notice of, and when
they are all silent, begin some strange panegyric, that may call off the at-
tention of the audience from him who was speaking before, and make them
shut their ears against him. Do not move your hand too often by way of ap-
plauding any body, for that is low and vulgar; nor rise up to speak above
once or twice at most, but often smile to yourself, as if to shew your con-
tempt os all that is said3 sor to those who are inclined to censure, some occafion
may always be sound3 you must be confident and bold, have a lie always
ready, and an oath at your tongue’s end, envy, haued, calumny, and ma·
lice, these will soon make you celebrated and conspicuous·

“ So much sor your outward appearance: in private you may game, whore,
commit adultery, at least tell every body you dc, glory in it, and shew the
love-letters written to you ; endeavour to make yourself as handsorne as you
cam-that the women may seem to have some reason for admiring y0u;
this will be of use to you as an orator, as it will give you more affurance;
women are more loquacious than men, and have better talents for abuse:

⁴⁸ Feet.] This methodvof applause‚ by striking the feet on the ground, was, we have rea-
son to suppose, generally adopted by the ancients: a modern audience makes use of the
hands, for the same purpose, which is caster, and at the same time, perhaps, more exhilarat-
