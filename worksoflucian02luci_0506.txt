or his ntes, he built a temple there to this goddess : this is confirmed by
many circumstances. The statue of heris drawn by lions, with a drum,
and a tower on her head, as the Lydians always represent Rhea. The
priests, he moreover observed, do not castrate themselves in honour of Juno,
but of Rhea, and in imitation of Attis. These reasonings appeared plau-

sible tome, but by no means satisfactory, as Ihave heard a much more
probable cause affigned for the castration.

The account given by the Greeks is, to me, the most satisfass’tory3 that
Juno is the goddess, and the temple the work of Bacchus, the son of Semele,
who came from AEthiopia into Syria : there are many things in the temple
which confirm this opinion ; such as the apparel of several barbarous

nations, Indian jewels, and the horns of elephants, which Bacchus brought

from AEthiopia: there are, likewise, in the porch, two large Phalli, with
this inscription z

BACCHUS DEDICATES THESE '⁴ PHALLI To ms MOTHER-lN-LAW JUNO.

This, to me, is sufficient proof; to which it may be added, that the Gre-
cians always offer up these Phalli to Bacchus, making little wooden men,
called ψ Neurospastae, which they carry about : there is one of the same kind
in the temple, but made of brass.

Such are the traditions which I met with concerning the first foundation
of this temple, which Ishall describe, giving an account of its situation,
the materials, the building of it, and by whom: some say the old struc‘ture
is long since gone to ruin, and that the temple, which we now see, is the
work of ζ Stratonice, wife of the king of Affyria, whom her son-in—law fell
in love with, and was discovered by the ingenuity os his phyfician. The
young man had conceived a violent paffion for her, and looking upon it as
a crime, concealed it from every body, and fickened in silence: he made
no lamentations, but lost his colour, and grew thinner and thinner every
