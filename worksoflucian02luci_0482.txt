of the meat, is so bad, that I arn almost afhamed to mention it; whilst you
are gorging, they pass by these poor wretches, and take no notice of them;
with many other tricks of this kind that are very unworthy of you. Equality
is the life and soul of festivals, and, sor this purpose, a distributor is appoint-
