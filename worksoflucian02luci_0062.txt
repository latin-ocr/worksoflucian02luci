56 OnASTRoLOGY.

they suffer any viciffitudes of seasons‚ but remain for ever in the same tern-
pernte climate. When they perceived, therefore, that the moon appeared
in various forms, they considered it as a matter worthy of admiration, and
diligent enquiry z by which they discovered the cause of those changes, and
found out that the moon had no light of her own, but borrowed it from the
sun. They discovered also the motion of those stars which we call ⁴* planets,
(as they are the only ones that move,) with their nature, power, and pro-
perties3 they gave them names also, or rather figns‚ expreffive of their seve.-
ral situations. Such were the observations on the heavens, made by the
AEthiopians, who delivered down the imperfe& art to their neighbours the
AEgyptians‚ who greatly improved it, and measured out time, by days,
months, and years3 their months being determined by the moon and her
changes, and their years by the circuit of the sun. But they soon performed
much more than this: dividing the space occupied by the fixed stars in which
the other were moved about, into † twelve parts, and to these, affigned the
forms and names of different creatores, men, beasts, birds, and fishes. The
religions ceremonies, therefore, of the AEgyptians, are of different kinds:
they did not draw their divinations from the whole twelve, but from parti-
eular figns, those who looked towards the ram, worshipped hirn3 they
would not eat fifh who lived under ᾖ· Pisces; nor did those sacrifice a goat,
who were beneath Capricorn. Some propitiare one divinity, and some an-
other. Some worship a bull in honour of the eoelestial Taurus; and Apis is
an objeet of adoration to them, because he pastures in that region, where an
oracle is constituted by him.

The Libyrnis, not long after, took up this scienee; for there we meet
with the oracle of Ammon, and they worship Jupiter under the figure ofa
ram. The Babyloni-ans were also acquainted with it, as they report‚ indeed,
befire all other nations; but, 1 am of opinion, this knowlege did not reach
thern till many ages after. The Greeks were not taught astrology either by
the AEthiopians or AEgyptians, but by Orpheus, the son of Oeager and Cal-

* Flamin] From the Greek mmmm, errans, a wanderer.

,ἶ Plsccs] From the soleinnity of Lucian's countenance at his first setting out, an old aea
quaintance (and suchI esteem myself‚ having had a long conversation with him), may easily
perceive that he is in jest ; when he tells υς, with a grave face, that the people who lived un.
der Pisces would not emfisb, nor those beneath Capricom touch agoat, ἃς. is not the ridicule

as strong as possible, and does it not sufficiently point out the author? To apply, what was once
said of Erasmus, aut Lucianus est, aut Diabolus.
