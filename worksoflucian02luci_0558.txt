‘⁴ Then came light, incorruptible, unseen, incomprehensible, which dis-
pelled the darkness, and confusion with a word, as the †ss0w·tongued pro-
phet expresserit it; he placed the earth upon the waters, spread out the
heavens, formed those {lars whom you worship asgods, and pointed out their

The whole, however, in this dialoguffi of what is supposed by thc eritics to refle& cn the Chris-
tian religion, and its rites and ceremonies, is, in my opinion, so obscure and imperfec‘l, that
no true judgmcnt can be formed concerning it. The author, whoever he was, seems only to
have colleeled a few scattered reports about a new religion, probably tbe Christian, the nature
and merit of which he was very little acquainted with. The ssight and contemptuous manner
in which he treats it, is not, therefore, at all to be wondcred at, nor moute* ir, Ξ think, be ar· ·

:ibusing it.

Luciam who, I am rather inclined to think, wrote the Philopatris, has frequently been con-
demned, I know not why, as a bitter enemy to the Christian religion, though he has said, after
all, very little about it, being a matter which it is apparent he knew nothing of. Ι with no
more harm had been done to it by some of its friends.
