but you cannot bear the darkness», it seems which is to surrvund me, and are
afraid Ishall be choaked in my grave3 but please to remembm, when my
eyes are putrified, or burned, if you mean to burn me, Ishall not be able to
distinguish light from darkness: but, moreover, of what service to me will
be all your grief, the beatings of the breast, and women’s lamentations, the
sepulchre crowned with flowers, or the wine poured upon it, do you think it

companion; a poor AEgyptian frequently gets money to maintain himself by
pawning his dead relations ; then come pyrmnids, tombs, monuments, and
inscriptions, which last, heaven knows, but a very little time, and are truly
idle and ridiculous: some have instituted sports and funeral orations at the

tombs of the deceased, 'as if they meant to plead his cause, and give a fa-
vourable charai'ter of him to thejudges below; after all these comes the re-

lations feast3 the kindred meet to comfort the parents, and force them to
take some refreshment, which they need not do, for they who have failed
