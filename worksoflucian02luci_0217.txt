ICARO-MENIPPUS. 211

Not so, by Jove l Ι have been amongst the stass themselves.
“ F R Ι Ε N D.
You must have had a long dream, indeed, to travel so many leagues
m it.
M E N 1 P P U S.
It is no dream, l affure you3 Ι am just arrived from Jupiter.

F R I E N D.
How, say you? Menippus, let down from heaven ?
. M E N I P P U S.
Even so: this moment come from thence, where Ι have seen and heard
things most strange and miraculous. If you doubt the truth of them, [he
happier ihall Ι be to have seen what is past belief.

FRIEND.

How is it poffible, most heavenly and divine Menippus, that a mere
mortal‚ like ine, should dispute the veracity of one who has been carried
above the cloud33 one, to speak in the language of Homer, of the * inhas
bitants of heaven. But inform me, I beseech you, which way you got up,
and how you procured so many ladders : for, by your appearance, Ι lhould
not take you for another † Phrygian boy, to be carried up by an eagle, and

made a cup-bearet of.
M E N 1 P P U S.

You are an old scoffer Ι knOW, and therefore I am not surprised that an
account of things, above the comprehensions of the vulgar, should appear
like a fable to you ε but, let me tell you, Ι wanted no ladders, noran eagle’s
beak to transport me thither3 for I had wings of my own.

F R I E N D.

This was beyond Daedalus himself, to be metamorphosed thus into a hawk,
or jay, and we know nothing of it.

M E N 1 P P U s.

You are not far from the mark, my friend ; for my nings were a kind os
Daedalian contrivance.

ἃ Inhabitants] Greek, εραωων, caelicolae, Homer’s general name for the gods.

ἦ· Ph2ygian boy,] Ganymede, whom Jupiter fell in love with, as he was huming on mount
Ida, and turning himself into an engle, carried up with him to heaven. 1 am sure, says Me-
nippus's friend, archly enough, you were not carried up there, like Ganymede, for your
beauty.
