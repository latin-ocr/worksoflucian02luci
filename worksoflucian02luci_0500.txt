494 LAPITHAE‚0RTHEBANQUET.‚

Thus finished the feast, which, after many melancholy events, ended at
last in mirth, so far as it concerned ion, Alcidamas, and Dionyfidorus; the
rest were carried off wounded. Zenothemis, in particular, suffered most
severely, quitting the field with one hand on his eye, and the other on his
nose, crying out, that he was a dead man3 whilst Hermon, who had lost
two of his teeth in the fray, could not help crying out, as he met him,
“ Remember Zenothemis, that pain is no evil.'' The bridegroom Dioni-
cus, having dressed his wounds, was carried home, with his head bound up,
in the chariot that was intended for the bride, lamenting the unhappy cele-
bration of his nuptials. Diocles took care of the rest as well as he could;
many of them were carried off in their sscep, and cascading all the way. As
sor Alcidamas, he ssaid there, nor could the servants get him out, when he
had once thrown himself on the couch, and got to sseep.

Thus concluded our brznquer, my dear Philo, of which the Tragic Muse
may ’ἢκ thus sing,

How strange and various are the fates of men !

Oft times the Gods‚ unhoped for blessings send,

And oft times that which most we look'd for, mocks
Our vain exch‘tance -—-

For things most strange and unexpected did there happen3 for my own
part, I learned from it, that it is very dangerous for any man who is not fond
of quarrels, to eat and drink with philosopherS.

⁸ Ραὶη, &c.] A favourite absurd opinion of the Stoics, which has been the subject of ridicule
from the time of Luciun to this day.

-ξ Thusfing] The verses here subjoined‚ are taken from the end of the Alcesses of Euripides.
