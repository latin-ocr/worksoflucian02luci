35 OnDANCING.

his covering you hear him crying out, sometimes high, and sometimes low,
and channiing his sorrows in iambic verse, minding nothing but his voice,
scr every thing else used to be supplied by the poet himself: as long as only
Hecuba or Andromache spoke, this was tolerable 3 but when Hercules comes
to sing alone, he forgets the club and the lion's ssdn, drops the character, and

may be said to make a solecism indeed.

You alledge, that in dancing‚ men a& the part of women ς, now this is*
commonly done both in tragedy and comedy, for ⁴* in both there are more
⁴women than rnen: in comedy, the principal parts, to make the audience
langh, are given to the ridiculous characters, cooks, scullions, Davus‘s, and
Tibius's ε on the other hand, how neat and decent the habit and appearance of
the danceris, I need not remark, one must be blind not to see it: add to this,
that the mask is always handsome, and suited to the action, not gaping like·
the other, but with the mouth shut. There are, indeed, other mouths⁴
enough to open in praise of it. lt was formerly usual for the same person
both to fing and danee3 but, finding that ihortness of breath from quick,
motion spoiled the song, they relieved the dancer, and appointed a person to*
sing ἔγ under him. With regard to other thing5‚ tragedy and dancing are

nearly the same, except that the latter has more variety, and is ‡ more in-v

struffive.
The reason why there are no exercises, or prizes for dancing appointed?
in Greece, was, Ι suppose, because the magistrates thought it too noble and

by no means trne3 in Lucian's time, however, for ought we know, it might have been so.
Women, it is almost certain, never acted either in comedy or tragedy‚ and most probably were
not then thought capable of it. What would Lucian say, if he could come amongst us, (ο a

with, one man danchrg, and another explaining his motions in a song; a great deal of rkill and

supported by the Abbe du Bos. See his Reflefflons on Painting and Poetry.
