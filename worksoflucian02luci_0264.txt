258 THEPARASITE.

was the sweetest of all ends3 but still preferred the life of the parasite. Para*
sites, you will observe, at that time were called guest33 and how does he speak
of thern ! sor again, it will be worth while to recur to his verses, nor can they,
indeed, be properly understood, unless we often repeat them,

Epicurus himself stole his summurn bonum frorn the parafite3 and an impu*-
dent theft it was, for Epicurus did not † enjoy that happiness, which he dee
clares to bc his great end; whilst the parasite really doth ;- for pleasure, in=
my opinion, confists in having a ss body free from pain or trouble, and a*
mind totally divested of all care and solicitude. Now the parasite poffeffes>
both these, and the Epicurean neither3 for those who are perpetually hunt-
ing after the §figure of the earth, the magnitude of the sun, infinite worlds,
and their distances from each other, and the first elements of thing33 disput-r
ing whether there are any gods or not, and quarrelling amongst themselves
about the end of every good, surely may be styled not merely subjee‘c to hu-

better situation than it is; never disturbed by such thoughts as t-hese, eata*
and drinks in peace and safety, and lays all along with his hands and feet in

pose, were not ambitious of imitating him in this particular, but were truly what Horace calb

minate opinion concerning ir,) may be round, oval, or lenticulam triangular, pyramidas, square,
hexaedrical, or of any other plain figure, especially if it be unmoved: ‘⁴ Most maintain the
world, (say he‚) (ο be as immortal and bleffe-1, so also round, because Plato denieth any figure
to be more beautiful than that ς, but to me, that of the cylinder‚ or the square, or the cone, or
