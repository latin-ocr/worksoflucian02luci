ILLITERATE BooK-HUNTER. 361

As to ceafing to buy books, nothing can be more casy3 you are learned
enough already, and have wisdorn sufficient3 have all the ancients at your
tongue’s end; are a complete mffster of history3 know every Aitic word,
with all the arts of speech, its beauties‚ and its faults; by the multitude os
books you have purchased, you must, no doubt, have attained to perfeetion
in every science: but may Ι ask you (for as you are so fond of being laughed

Euripides, where she says,
ᾗ Nor fear the horrors of the conscious night,

Or the dread voice, that from the speaking walls-5

go, purchase books, lock thern up, and glory in the poffeffion of them13
thisis sufficient for you : but never touch or read them, never quote any of
the ancient orators or poets who have done you· no harm- Ι know my jests
are all thrown away upon you, and that I arn endeavouring, as the proverb
says, To 11 wash a black-moor white. Yon will still buy books, still make

·* AE‘fi-hines⁷s.] In this oration, which is still extant, the reader will find Lucian’s reason for

Ifthe reader is defirous of being farther acquainted with them, Ι would refer him to the pas·
fage, and the notes upon it.
