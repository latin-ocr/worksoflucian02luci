TOXARIS. 109

though immensely high, made no shadow, and the latter founded wonder-
fully at the rifing of the sea: to see and hear these extraordinary things, he
took a voyage of fix months up the Nile, leaving behind his friend Anti-
philus, who was deteri-ed by the length of the journey, and heat of the cli-
mate, from aecompanying him thither. During this time it was, that Anti-
philus met with one of those misfortunes which seem more peculiarly to call
for the affistance ofa good and generous friend: his servant, it seemS, one
Syrus, had entered into a confederacy with some sacrilegious villains, who
broke into the temple of Anubis, and stole away two golden cups, a sceptre,
some filver seals with the dogs head on them, and other things, all of
which, they brought to, and lodged with Syrus. Being afterwards taken
and put to the ’Ψ tortum, they confeffed the facit, and sent the officers to Anti-
philus’s house, where they found the stolen goods hid under the bed. He,
and Syrus, were both taken, bound, and sent to pris0n; not one of those
who had before kept him company, dai-ing to relieve or affist him, conclud-
ing him to have been guilty of sacrilege, and that those would be impious
and defiled, who even eat or drank with him. His two other servants, after
pillaging the house of every thing that remained‚ ran away. The wretched
Antiphilus. was now confined in a dungeon, and treated as the worst of malefac-
tors; the goaler himself, who was a superstitious AEgyptian, thinking he did a
meritorious service to his God, revenged the injury offered to him, by oppres.
fing this unhappy criminal, who, if at any time he denied‘t'ne fait, was only
deemed the more insolens, and was treated accordingly. Heston grew fickand
emaciated, as well he might, laying on the ground, and not able evento stretch

out his feet, which were bound right with a cord. In the day-time, indeed,

ssones placed in any particular manner 'could produce such sounds.’' Others imagine-d,
‘⁶ That it was some secret contrivance, probably an instrument concealed in the body ofthe sta-
tue, the chords of which, after being relaxed by the inoist night air, recovered their tone and
elasticity‚ hythe heat of the sun ;'’ which, with all due deference to the learned Strabo, is bnt
an aukward solution of the riddle. lt was more probably some trick of the ancient priests, sor

mystery, broke the statue in two, bnt it secius to little purpose, fer the remaining part, we ’,ης

Α fine application of this suble, is made by Dr. Akenside in his Pleasures of the Imaginariffli,
one of the fine-st poems in our language.
