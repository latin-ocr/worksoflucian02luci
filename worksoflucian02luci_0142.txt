’¹35 THE A S S.

grind all the corn and barley. An ass of any gratitude‚ indeed, would never
grudge grinding sor his masters 3 but the good woman must needs affist her
friends, of whom she had a great many, with corn also, and my neck suffered
for it. She would even put the barley for my own dinner into the mill, and
make cakes of it for herself, whilst 1 was forced to take up with the bran :
befides that, when 1 was let in among the mareS, the horses grew jealous,
and searing Ι should heroo intimate with their wives, kicked and bit me most
suriuussy. In ashorttime, lgrew terribly thin and lank‚ being not very
happy at the mill when within doors, and when Ι got out, well beat and
bruised by my compatriotis in the field. l was often, moreover, sent up to
the mountain, and obliged to carry wood; this, indeed, was the worst of
my missortunes; sor, in the first place, the mountain was very stecp‚ and in
the next, I had no ssioes on in a rough road. They sent, withal‚ a mule—
driver along with nie, a rascally boy, who was always whipping me without
mercy; though l went on as fast as Ι could, he kept still beating me, not
with a plain ssiek, but nobbed, always striking me on the same part of the
thigh, till it was laid quite open, and still followed his blow3 putting such
burthens upon me, at the same time, as an elephant would scarce have been
able to carry. Though the descent was very steep, he continued thumping

get up and ride over it. If weary and overburthened, I chanced to fall, it
was still worse with me; for he would never get down to help me, but con-
tinued belabouring my back and fides, till he had raised me up again3 and,
sor this purpose, he got a bundle of thorns, which he tied to my tail3 these
pricked me as 1 went along, and wounded my posteriors in the most dreadful
manner3 whilst lrcould by no poffible means relieve myself, as what inflicted
the wound, hung always close to me; ancl ifI went ssow to escape the thorns,
the club saluted me, and if 1 pushed on to avoid the club, the thorns stuck
in me immediately ε the villain plyed them both, with a defign to make an
end os me. At length, after a thousand insults, being out of all patience, I
lifted up my beel, and gave him a kick, which he never sorgave me. Being
one day ordered to carry some stubble out of one field into another, he saddled
me with it, and taking a rope, tied me to the load; not without defign, for
having stolen a hot pocker out of the fite, he put it into the stubble, which,
