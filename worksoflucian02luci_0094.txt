88 DEFENCEOF THEPORTRAIT.

Ι have heard, said ssie, (whether it be true or not, you rnen know best,>
that the vietors at the Olympic garnes are not permitted to have statues of
them made bigger than themselves; that the judges always take care of this,
and are even more nice in the examination of thern than of the candidates.
Take care, therefore, that your measure also is emet, or thejudges will re-
iect your portraits.

Such is her opinion of your persorrnance: Iwould advise you, there·
foi-e, Lycinus‚ to revise and correct it, that you may not be accused of im-
piety. She appeared, indeed, herself, highly displeased at some parts, and
seemed to shudder at them, deprecating the wrath of the goddesses, to ren-
der them propitious to her, and incline thern to pardon a weak woman. To
say the truth, l am, myself, a little of her opinion: when I heard you, in-
deed, first repeat it, 1 found no fault3 but after what she said, began, Iown,
to think as she did. It is the sanie thing with regard to opinions, as with
objeets of sight; when the thing is close to us, andjust before our eyes, we
cannot observe ir distinffly3 but if we draw back a little, and view it at a
proper distance, it is all clear and plain, and we see immediately what is

To compare a mere mortal with Juno and Venus, what is it in effe& but to
depreciate the goddesses? for, in this case, the leffer is not made so much
greater by the comparison, as the greater is diminifhed and degraded by it;
for, is two men wall< together, one very tali, and the other extremely short,
if you would make them appear of equal height, you cannot do it by setting
the little one on his rip-roes, but by the tall man’s stooping down to him;
ard, in like manner, the divine nature must be diminirhed and made lower
by your comparison. If, indeed, for want of terrestrial objects, you are
obliged to have recourfe to celestial ones, the fault will be more venia13 but
when you had so many mortal women before you, to compare her to Venus
and juno was totally unneceffary. Take off, therefore, my good friend,
what is more than sufficient, and what is obnoxious: this whole piece, in-
deed, is foreign to your nature and disposition ; for you are seldorn inclined to
panegyric, though at present so wonderfully altered, that from a niggard in
Praise, you on a sudden are grown prodigalof it; but never be afhamed of
mending. Phidias did so, when he made his Jove3 for when he first pro-
duced his work, he stood behind the door and listened to those who either

praised or condemned it. One found fault nith the nose because it was too
broad,
