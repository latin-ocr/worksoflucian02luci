Theagenes, I mean: for, hearing the noise, he came up, and vented a
thousand execrations against the speaker, whoever he was, for I know nor

When we came to Olympia, the back part of the temple was crouded

many dangers and troubles he had gone through in the cause of ti'uth and
virtue: he talked a great while, but, on account of the croud which preffed

his will. Their crying out, do it, was so unexped'ted, that, cadaverous as

eafily suppose how much I was diverred at him. A fellow, so vain—glorious,
