ence, and to shew that you have enough to throw away even upon what is
unnecess'ary3 though even l, who am an illiterate ⁵⁸ byrian, very well know,

Bw, afta-all, perhaps you were persuaded into it by your flatterers‚ who
made you believe thur you were not only handsorne and agreeable, but a most
learned inin, an orator, and historian 2 you buy books therefore to keep up
the chan-aem they have given you: you recire before them, they say, ar
mule, whilst they, like so many thirsty f1·og5‚ croak out your pmises, and
cannot dr'nk till they burst with acclamations; it is no wonder you are † led
by the nofe, and believe every thing they say, when, not long ago, they
