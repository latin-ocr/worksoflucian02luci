DEFENCEoF THE PORTRAIT. 91

which 1 drewof your person, to the Cnidian and Gardcn Venus, and like-
wise to Juno and Minerva. It is an old observation, that painters and pocts
are not to be called to account for what they say; much less, consequently,
such as write in humble prose, like myself: praise is free, nor is there any
law to limit the fize and extent ofit: all it is bound to is, to prove the ob-
je& praised worthy of admiration, and of imitation also· ButI shall not
dwell on this argument, lest you should say, it is because I have no other to
produce: alll 1hall now contend for is, that in panegyric we have a right
to make use ofimages and fimilitudes‚ and the principa} merit is to draw
a fit* comparison. We must not compare one thing with another that is equal
to it, or that is inferior, but with what is more excellent: if you speak of a
dog, and say be is better than a sow or a cat, what extraordinary praise is it?
or, if you compared him to a wolf, would it be any great encomium? What
then would be the proper similitude? Doubtless, to say, he was eqnal in fize
and strength to a lion. When the * poet speaks of Orion's dog, he calls him
the lion-tamer: this is the highest praise he could bestow on him. If a man
were to make an encomium on ’ᾗ Milo the Crotonian, Glaucus of Carystus,
or Polydamas, and should say, that each of them was stronger than a wo-
man, would not you think him injest? nor would it be sufficient to say,
that either of these would be superior to any one man. But how has the
noble poet described Glaucus,

Doth he not put forth
The strength of Pollux, or the iron son
Of great Alcmena ——-

You see how. he compares him to the gods, nay, even makes him superior
to them·, and yet neither did Glaucus resent his being likened to the gods,
nor did the gods punish Glaucus or the poet3 both, on the contrary, were
held '111 the highest esteem and veneration by the Greeks; Glaucus sor his
wonderful strength, and Homer sor the celebration of him. wonder 1101,
