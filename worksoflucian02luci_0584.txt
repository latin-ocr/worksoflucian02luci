Whom erst ¹ Megaera, dreadful Fury, bore;
And from her poison'd breasts Alefflio fed :
XVhat daemon fraught with malice sent thee forth
To range o'er wretched earth, and plague mankind ?
If mortals‚ for their crimes committed here,
Are doom’d to suffer in the realms below,
Why offer Tantalus th’ elufive wave,
Why torture poor Ixion with his wheel'‚
Or bid the wretched Sisyphus uproll
The still-revolving stone? Confign’d to thee,
And to thy tendon-racking pangs, the guilty
Had mourn‘d a heavier p<uniss1ment,—Alas!
How is the dry and wither’d body torn
By ceaseless agonies! from head to foot
With loathsome poison fill’d, that pent withinz
Adds double mis'ry, whilst thy tyrant force
Writhes my full veins, and stops up ev'ry pore ς,
The fiery mischicf thro’ my bowels runs,
And with its flames consumes my trembling flesti.
Ev’n so, thro' AEtna's hoarse-resounding caves,
Or where Sicilia's burning ψ rocks o’erhang
Tbe narrow sea, in spiry wreaths bursts forth,
The never-ceafing flame: thou ζ cure-less ill!
How vain the pow’r of med'eine to affuage,
Or mitigate thy wrath, alas! how vain
Our foolish hopes, but flatt'ring to deceive?
