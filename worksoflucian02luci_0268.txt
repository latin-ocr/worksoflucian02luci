262 TnePARASITE.

sciences: if we can prove that parasitism is far beyond these, it must ag
evidently ssiine forth the sovereign of arts, as * Nauficae was the queen of
chamberrnaids.

First then, it excels both rhetoric and philosophy, as being a real and adtual
substance, concerning which, all are agreed3 whilst, with regard to the
others, they are not. As to rhetoric, it is not one and the same thing with
every body ; for some call it an art, others no art at all, and others a bad and
mischievous one, and so on: in like manner, philosophy is not always the
same, it is one thing with the Stoics, another with the Epicureans, another
with the AcademiCS, and another with the Peripatetics; to this day its pro-
feffors are not agreed in their opinion of it : from these two we may form an
idea of the rest: Icannot possibly call that an art, which is not so much as a
real substance. Arithmetic, indeed, is always one and the farne, two and
two make four with the Greeks as well as Perfims, in this point, Greeks and
barbarians never differ: but many and diverse are our philosophies, and we
plainly perceive, that neither their principle nor their ends are the same.

What you say is too true; for the profeffors call philosophy one fimple

thing, and yet themselves split it into a hundred.

In other profesfions, perhaps, some inconfistencies may be pardoned‚ and
some errors paffed over; but to philosophy, which is the teacher of nuth,
unity is effentially necessary ; and who can bear to see it, like so many dis,
cordant instruments‚ disagreeing with itself? it cannot be a fimple thing, al-
ways one and the same, because we see several different kinds of it; now,
different kinds of it there cannot be, because, if it is philosophy, it must be
one and the same. We may argue in the same manner also with regard to
rhetoric3 when all do not say the same on the subjetst proposed, but perpe..
tually dil'agree in their opinions„ it is plain to a demonstration, that obje&
can have no realaclual existence, the perceptions arifing from which, are
not universally the same; when the thing is contested, to whom can it be,
long? its never being found in any particular person, at once destroys its ex.²
istence, But it is not so with parasitisrn, which is the same, both amongst
Greeks and barbarianS, in its praeiit-e, and in the manner of it, nor can it
ever be said, that one man is a parasite in one way, and another in another:
