THE WISHES. 413

and he was without, and led me all about3 but finec that time 1 have never
set eyes on him, either on board, or fince we came on shore.

Do you recollee‘t, LycinuS, when we first miffed him? 1 believe it was
when that pretty girl carne out of the cabbin, dreffed in white linen, with
her hair tied behind, and quite back from her forehead: if 1 know any
thing of Adimantus, at such a fight as this he would soon leave the man who

was {hewing him the AEgyptian ssiip, and fall a-crying, as he used to do3 for

women of faihion amongst us have been at no little pains and expence to preserve this subordi-
nation, but in vain, for the lower order ape their betters so well, aud wear their heads so high,
that it is very difficuk, at present, to distinguish a woman of the first rank from her chamber-
maid.

† Grasi-hoppers] The grasshopper‚ was worn in the hair by the Athenians as emblems that
they were Αυτοχθονες, sprung {rom the earth, or descendants from the ‚first inhabitants οῖ’
