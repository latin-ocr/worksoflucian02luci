³ Aristippus] The disciple of Socrates. After the death of his master, he retired to his own
country, Cyrene, and instituted a feet, called from thence the Cyrenaic; his distinguistring
characteristic was, that he could conform himself to every place, time, and person, and, like
the apostle Paul, become all things to all nien, as Horace says,
