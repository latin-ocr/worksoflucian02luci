100 TOXARIS.

drearns, and leave you, like those mute personages in the drama, who gape
with immense wide mouths, and say nothing. We, on the other hand, by
as much as we fall short of you in words, by so much do we excel you in our
aetions, at least with regard to this subject.

Let us then make this agreement; we will permit, on both fides, the
friends of former ages to remain in peace3 for there, 1 think, you would
have the better of me, as your poets bear witness, who, in most harmonious
metre, have sung the praises of Achilles and Patrocles, Theseus and Piri-
thous, with others of equal renown3 and let each of us produce some few
examples in our own times, I from Scythia, and you from Greece3 and
whichever shall bring instances of the most noble and difinterestcd friendship,
{hall be declared vietor in this honourable contest. For my own part, rather
would I be conquered in single fight‚ and have my right hand cut off,
(which is the punishment inflieted amongst υ5,) than be overcome, espec-
ally a Scythian by a Greek, in this particular.

It ῖς ηο easy talk, ‘let me tell you, Tox-ariS, to engage hand in hand with
such a warrior 35 you are, one who so well knows how to aim the * arrows
Of his wit and eloquence. ChaHenged, however, unexpeetedly as I arn,
1 will not tamely give up the cause of Greece; shameful and ignominious,
indeed, onld it be, when ui* they two alone could cono-uer so many Scy-
thiam, as fame and your ancient pictures record, which yousshavejust now
so tragically set forth ; if, after this, so many cities, and nations, all Greece
ffimssd yield the palm, and be overcome by you alone : were this to liappen,
Issmuld deserve not to lose my right hand, as you say, but to have my
[ongue cut out. But how is it to be? must each of us producejust so many
ffiffldly affiong, or, is he who can bring the most, to be declared conqueror?

T O X A R I S·

By no means: we are not to confider the quantity of examples, but the

qualityot' them. If your ariows are ssiarper‚ and more penetrating than

mine, though only equal in number, they will make the deeper wounds,
and I {hall yield the sooner to thern.

2*- >Tho arra-um] ln allusion to the manner of fighting generally made use of by the Scythians
with bows and armws, in which they were reinarkably ikilsul.
