and of no rank in Scythia, seemed astothed, and said, “ How many herds
aridfflaggons may you be possefl'ed of? for these, I knOW, are your riches.³*
‘⁶ I have neither, replied Arsacomas, but l have two good and worthy friends,
such as no Scythian can boast of belides me.’' They laughed at him for this
speech, as if he had been mad or drunk3 and the next day, Adyrmachns

being preferred to all the rest, prepared to carry off the bride into his own·
country.

No sooner was Arsacomas returned horne, than he acquainted his two
friends how contemptuoussy he had been treated at the feast, and laughed at:
on account of his poverty3 “ and when, said he, Ι told them how rich I was
in having such friends as you, so much more valuable than all then-trea-
sures, the king despised and derided you also, and gave his daughter to
Adyrmachus, because he had ten golden vessels, and four-score waggons,
and many flocks and herds‚ preferring cattle, trifling cups, and heavy car-
riages, to men of honour and virtue. I am doubly injur-ed, my friends, fon
Ι love Mamaea, and am not a little hurt befides, by an affront fio publicly

bride for him: be it s0, and do you, says he, Arsacomas, in the mean time,
remain here3 and, as we must expe& a speedy war, prepare arms, horses,
and men sor it : you are a good man, and we have many servants and de-
pendent53 numbers, therefore, Idoubt not, willjoin your cause, especially
ifyou fit on the bull's hide.” The thing was immediately agreed on, Lon-
chates set out forthe Bosphorus, and Macentes for Machlina, on horse-back,
whilst Ars-<iconias stayed at home to arm the forces : at length he sat on the
hide.

The custom of fitting on the hide is as follows: if any man is highly in·
jnred by another, and is unable to revenge himself, he sacrifices an QX, cuts
up the flesti, and cix-effes it, then spreading the skin on the ground, fits down·
on it with 'nis hands placed behind his back, as if chained at the arm :v this,
