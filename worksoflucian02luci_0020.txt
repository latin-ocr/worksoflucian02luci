¹4 ALEXANDEmon,

Such was the state of the affair near home, in Ionia, Cilicia, Paphlagonia,
and Gallo-Graecia 3 but when the fame of the oracle had reached as far as
Italy and Rome, they crouded as fast as poffible one upon another; some
came themselves, some sent messengers to him, particularly the great men,
and those who were poffeffed of the highest honours and dignities: the first,
or as one may say, the head of these, was Rutilianus, a man in every other
respe& of good charaeter and reputation, and who had acquitted himself in
several public employments; but in religious matters superstitiouS, and even
as it were, disordered in his mind, entertaining the wildest opinions concern-
ing them, who, if he found but a stone m his way, anointed or crowned with
a garland, would fall down 1n adoiation, and ask some favour of rt. This
man, as soon as he heard of the oracle, was with difficulty restrained from
leaving his bufiness‚ and making a visit to the wall of Abonus. He sent,
however, several meffengers, one after another3 these, being most of thern
ignorant servants, were easily deceived ; and when they came back, report-
ed what they had seen and heard, with some improvements of their own;
which they added to recommend themselves the better to their master. This
excited the poor old man's curiosity, and drove him almost to madness. As
he was acquainted with most of the great men of the city, he ran about, and
told them every thing he had heard from the servants; to which he likewise
made some additions. In this manner he raised the attention of the whole
city, and set them all in motion, persuading several of the courtiers to apply
immediately to him, and enquire about their own affairs. Our her0.not only
received them with the greatest hospitality‚ but sent thern back loaded with
meseum, insomuch, that not content with publishing his answers, they sound-‚
ed forth the praises of the deity, and related a thousand miraculous stories,
concerning both the oracle and the prophet. ’

Our thrice renowned rascal now thought on another scheme, which was
by no means an impolitic one, but truly worthy of an illustrious ro‘bber : and
this was to open and look into all the books which were sent, and if he found
any thing in them bold or of a dangerous tendency‚ those he would keep
without sending b'ack any answer3 by which means, he made the authors
intirely subservient to him, and keept them {n perpetual fear, as well
knowing of what nature their questions were. One may eafily guess, in—
deed, with regard to the rich and great, what would most probably be the
subjctst of them.
