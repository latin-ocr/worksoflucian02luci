LYCINUS.

Very well : now we have artists enough ε from all these I propose to make
one picture, selecting what is most excellent in each of them.

POLYSTRATUS.

And how is this to be done?

L Y C Ι N U S.
With the greatest ease : let us only transfer the ideas to language, whose
business it shall be to mix together the several parts, adorn, and form them
into one complete whole.

POLYSTRATUS.

Well, take and try: for my part, Ι cannot conceive how you can make
use of them in such amanner, as from so many different parts, not to form
one ill-commeted and ridiculous work.

L Y C 1 N U S.

Yon shall see: and first, from the Cnidian Venus Iffiall take the head
alone; the body, being naked, we have no occasion for : the forehead, hair,
and perse& shape of the eye-brows, exactly as Praxiteles has made them :
together with that ³¹⁶ swirnming softness, and vivacity of the eyes, which he
has so finely represented ε the cheeks‚ and look of the † full face, with the
extremeties of the hands, the fine-proportioned wrist‚ the delicate fingers
growing thiu at the tips, from Alcamenes. Phidias, and his Lemnian,
will supply us with the general turn of the countenance, and fize of the
nose3 the mouth and neck we will take from his Amazon. Calamides shall
furnifh us with the modesty of his Sosandra, the sweet hals-smile on her
countenance, the tucked up, and becoming robe3 her head, however, {hall
be undreffed: the age may be about that of the Cnidian Venus, according?

to Praxiteles. What think you, my friend, will not the pieture be charm-
ing, if it be well finissied?

ἃ Swimming.] The Greek expreffion is inimitably elegant,
Οφθαλμων το ὑγρᾶν αμα τω φαίδρω,
Oculorum mobilem hilaremque gratiam,
Agreeable to Anacreon’s
