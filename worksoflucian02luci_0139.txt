THE A S S. 133

banged about, Istruck my hoof against a ssim-p stone, which wounded mc
so terribly‚ thatI went lame 31111011 311 1116 rest of the journey. They cried
out, “ What do we keep this ass for, that is always stumbling‚ let us get
rid of such 311 ill—omen'd beast.’' “ Aye, says another, let us throw him
down headlong, by way of an expiatory offering for the company.’' They
seemed then to come round me for that purpose·‚ but hearing what they
were about, I put on, and thought no more of my wound‚ the fear of death
taking away my sense of pain.

When we got back to the inn, they took off 0111· burthem, lodged zhem
safe, and went in to supper ; but night coming on, they sallied forth again to
take care of the baggage which they had left behind. ‘⁶ There is no occa-
11011, said 0116 of thern, to take that lame ass with us, 116 6311 be of 110 service,
therefore, some of us must carry part of the burtheus, and the horsethe rest.’'
They took the horse, and went off: it was a bright moon—light night. “ And
why now, Lucius, said 1 to myself, should I then stay here for vulturs and
the offspring of vulturs to devour me? you heard what the thieves said about
you, why would you choose to be thrown down a precipice? it is night, and
the moon 11111165, there is nobody here, fly off, and save thyself from these
murtherers.” Whilst 1 was making these reflffiimxs, Ι perceived I was
quite loose, for the bridle hung upjust by me3 this encouraged me, and I
ran out of the stable as fast as I could : the old woman observing that I was,
marching off, caught hold of my tail, and hung by ir. Thrice worthy‚
thought 1, should I be of the precipice, or any other death, should Ι suffer
myself to be taken by 311 old woman, and away 1dragged her after me:
1116 cricd out for affistance on the young captive 1111111111, who coming 0111,
and seeing the old woman hanging like an ass’s tail, immediately conceived
a most noble design, and worrhy 013 desperate heroine, 1116 jumped up, and
seated herself upon me. Ι, partly from the hopes of escaping, and partly
to oblige my young rider, galloped off with all the speed of a horse, leaving
the old woman behind us. The virgin put up her prayers to the gods that
1116 might get 'off safe3 and, addreffing herself to me, ‘⁴ If, says 1116, my
lovely creature, you will carry me to my father‘s house, l will set you free
from all labour for the future, and you shall have as much barley as you 6311
eat every day for your dinner.” Thus encouraged, both by the hopes of es-
caping from the ruffians, and the advantages I expected by saving my young
mistress, Ι ran away nimbly, without ever thinking of my lame foot.
