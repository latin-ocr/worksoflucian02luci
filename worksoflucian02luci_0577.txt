CHARIDEMUS. 55¹

Those who excel in valour, or any other virtue, unless they conciliate our
affeetions, by conferring vperpetual obligations on ns, are generally the objeci-s
of envy and hatred3 but by the beautiful we are caught at first fight; we
do not envy, but love them beyond measure, worship thern as dcities, and
are never tired* of waiting on them : there is more pleasure in obeying thern,
than in conimanding others, and the more injune‘tions they lay upon, the
happier do they make us· With regard to other good things, when we
have acquired them, we look no farther3 but of beauty we never think we
have enough ε should we even excel the ²7⁶ son of Aglaia, who came with the
Grecians against Troy, or the fair Hyacinthus, 01· the Laccdaemoniam Nar-
cissus, we should still be afraid that one yet more beautiful might arise, and
be the admiration of posterity.

In every thing beauty is the great standard of perfectiori, which all
have in view: by this the general forms his army, the orator makes his
speech, the painter finissies his pi&u1·e; beauty is the great end of all τ and
so it is also in all those things which are neceffary and convenient to us. Me-
nelaus did not so much consult usefulness as beauty in his palace, ‘out endea-
voured to strike the eyes of all with admiration at their first entrance in it,
nor was he disappointed: for when the son of Ulyffes came there, in search
of his father, he so admired the sumptuousness and beauty of it, that he
said to Pisistratus, the son of Nestor, †

Such, and not nobler, in the realms above,
My wonder didiates, is the dome of Jove3

His father als0, when he led his ships against Troy, had them finely painted,
that they might be gazed at: all the arts, in short, if we examine them,
will be found to aim at beauty, as their great and principal object.

It is the ‡beautifu1, inoreover, which exalts the virtues, which adds

ἥ Son of, ἐσίω] Nereus, „of whom Homer speaks thus,

Nereus, in faultless ssiape and blooming grace,
The loveliest youth of all the Grecian race.

See Pope's Homer's Iliad, book ii. 1. 817.
† Alluding to the speech of Telemachus, on seeing the palace of Menelaus at Sparta. See
Pope’s Homer's Odyssey‚ book iv. 1. 84.

ζ ‘she beantzful] A doetrine which is at large illustrared by Plato, Cicero, lord Shaftesbury,
and many others. Surely this is not what Gesner calls puerile dechmadon, but the work of
Lucian, and by no means unworthy of him.
