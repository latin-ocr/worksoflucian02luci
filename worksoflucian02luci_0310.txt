it, one narrOW, rough, and overgrown with thorns and briars, scarce paff-
able, without much toil and labour; Hesiod has already engaged to (hew it,
and therefore you will not want my affistance : the other is broad, pleasant,
flowery, well-watered‚ such, in ssmrt, not to (letain you from the defired
obje&‚ as Ι before described to you. Here, however, Ι must not forget to
observe, that in the hard and rough wat, you will find very few footsteps,
and what there arc, of a long standing: I myself went that road like a fool
as Ι was, and took a great deal of unneceffiry pains. The Other plain and
even path, Isaw, indeed, at a distance, just as it now is, but would not
step into it, for when 1 was young, I did not know what was best for me,
but thought the poet must be right who tells us, that ’ἵ labour is the source
os happiness; but it is not s0, for 1 see numbers every day, who acquire the
good things of life, without toil or care, only by a happy choice of the right
road to them.

You will be in doubt, Iknow‚ at the beginning of the journey, which
path you {hall turn to; but 1 will instruit you how to reach with ease the
summit, to enjoy your beloved mistress, to be happy, and to be admired. It
is enough, that Ι was myself deceived and tired, for you every thing 111311
spring up without ploughing or sowing, as in the days of saturn.

And n0W‚ observe‚ there comes towards you a stout and hardy figure, ro-
bust and aetive, with a manly gait and gesture3 he comes to be your guide in ,
that rough and thorny way, and cornmands you to follow him : he will tell
you many an idle tale, shew you the steps of Demosthenes, Plato, and others,
steps much ψ larger than those of our dayS, but such as are now buried in
obscurity and oblivi0n3 these, he will say, if you tread in, you will soon
gain the lovely bride, and be happy: but it is like walking on a rope, for if
you go but ever so little beyond the line, or turn your foot to the right, 01·

⁰ Labour.] The paths of virtue must be reach’d by toil,
Arduous and long, and on a rugged soil ;
Thorny the path, but when the top you gain,
Fairis the future, and the prospe-St plain.

† Largam] A happy allufion to what Homer tells us ofHeAElor’s extraordinary strength, when,
as Garth‚ in his Epilogue to the Distress’d Mother‚ has humuroussy described it,
Hev threw a stone of such prodigious weight, ·

As no two men could list, not even of those,
Who in that tace of thundering mortale rose;

It would have strain'd a dozen—-modern beaux„
