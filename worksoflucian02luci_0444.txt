438 ΟΝ THE DEATH or PEREGRINUS.

and burned himself in filenee, alone, or accompanied only by his Thcage-
nes, by way of a faithful PhiloCtetes ? but he must needs do it at the Olym-
pic garnes, and in a full assenibly, roasting himself, as it were, on the stage :
not but it is a death which, by Hercules, he long since deserved‚ if parri-
cides ancl atheists are worthy of it: in this respect he was rather late3
he should have been roasted long ago in Phalaris’s bull‚ and not have pe-
rifhed in a moment; for Ι have often heard this is the shortcst way 'of dying,v
as it is only opening the rnouth, catching the 1131116, and expiring imme-
diately: bur he has fallen upon this expedient, 1 suppose, because it is grand
and magnificent for a man to be burned in a sacred ground, where no corpsc
can be buried. You all, no doubt, rernember him who wanted to be im-
mortal, and could lind no other way of becmning so but by setting fire to
the temple of Diam, at Ephesus. This 111311, such is his love of glory‚ is

ambirious of the same fate.
l-le tells us, that he does it to serve mankind, to teach them to despise
death, and suffer the rnost cruel torments : but Ι would ask one question of
you, not of him: Would you wish to have malefaitors imitate this forti-
tude, contemn death, burning alive, and such dreadful things? Iam sure
you would not. How then could Proteus know, that it would be of use
only to the good, and would not make the bad and vicious more fearless of
danger, and more audacious? But, even suppofing it might happen that
those only should see this who might think it conducive to public happiness,
yet let me ask you one more question : Would you have your children imi· ,
tate him? You will say, No. But why, indeed, need 1 asse this, when not
one even of his own disciples will do it. Theagenes, to say the truth, is
much to blame, seeing, that whilst he imitates him in every thing else, he
will not follow his steps in this also, and go to Hercules, as he says, along
with him, when he might, in so 111011 3 time, gain immortality, only by
leaping into the flames. There is not much rivalship in a satchel, a club‚
and a dirty gown3 these may all be had with ease and safety: 116 should
have imitated the great end, the crown of all; built up his pile of green
faggots, and suffocated himself in the stnoke. The fire is not peculial· to
Hercules and AEsculapius; those that are guilty of murther and sacrilege
are condemned to it; a little smoke, therefore, would be much better:
'that would be dying like yourselves, and yourselves only. Hercules burned
