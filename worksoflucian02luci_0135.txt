THE A S S. ¹29

my eyes, not knowing whether Ι was asseep or awake, and when at length
I found that it was a real fact, I begged Palaestra would let mc have some
wings t00, and, anointing me with some of the same ointmcnt, permit nie
to fly a little: as I wanted much to try whether, when Ihad quitted the
{hape ofa man, Ishould have the understanding only of a bird. She took
the first opportunity, therefore, of opening the chamber door privately‚ and
took out the box: Iundreffed as fast as poffiffle, and anointed myself all
over: when, lo, to my great mortification, I was not turned into 3 bird,
but on a sudden 3 1311 stuck out behind me, my fingers vanilhed, and of 311
my 113115 only four remained, which were changed into hoofs 3 my hands and
feet resembled those ofa beast‚ I had a large face, with long ears, and vie-‚v-
ing myself all round, perceived that Ι was metamorphosed into 311 ass3 my
human voice was entirely gone, so that Ι could no longer converse with Pa-
laestra, and all Ι could do was to stretch out my lips, look miserable, and
as well as Icould, accused her for making an ass instead of a bird of me.
“ Wretch that I am, cried she, beating herself with both her hands, what

roses, that shall set you right.'' An ass, therefore, 1 remained to all intents
and purposes, saving that in sense and understanding l was still a man, and
the true Lucius, though dumb.

Nota little displeased, therefore, at Palaestra for her miflake, 1 bit my
lips in filence, and made the best of my way to the stable, where my own
horse stood, and an ass belonging to Hipparchus: 35 10011 35 they saw me
come in, being afraid I‘should take part of their hay, they bent down their

their bellies, which Iperceiving‚ got 35 far as I could from the manger,
and laughed at them: though my laugh was nothing but a bray. Ι said to
myself, “ What a foolish curiosity was this of mine! if a wolf noyv, or some
other wild beast should break in, though 1 have done no harm, there would
be an end of me.’' Whilst Iwas making these reflections, little did I
think of the misfortune that was just coming upon me : for in the middle of
the night, when all were silent and asseep, 3 dreadful 110116 was heard on
