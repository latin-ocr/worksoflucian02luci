C R I T I A S.
This is an arithmetical oath3 you number like ᾗ Nicomachus; 1 do not

know what you rnean by your three one, and one three: are you talking
about Pythagoras’s Η four, his eight, or his thirty!

’ Τ R I E P H Ο N.

Away with earthly things, and talk no rnore about them: we are not
4 measuring fleas, Ι affure you : Ι shall teach you who was before all thing5‚
v'vhat theuniverseis‚ and what the system of it 3 1 have learned, and shall
communicate to you: though Iformerly knew no more than yourself: but
I have lit on a Galilaean, with a bald pate, and long nose, who travelled
through the air, and got up into the qs third heaven, where he learned the

ἰ’ By the δὴ] Gr. υψιμεέωτω θεον, psam, αμςροτοι, spanum, a parody of Homer, ludicroussy
applied: quo Luciani personam (says Solanus the commentator), melius agere videretur paro-

ἢ· Onefiom ξῖικ] Gr. Ἐν εκ ‘restam καῖ ἐξ ἔνος τρια. Luciam, 01· whoever was the author of
the Philopatris‚ is here supposed to allude to, and to ridiculethe Christian doetrine of the Tri-
nity. The manner of expreffing it differs, we may observe, from the famous verse of St. John,
about which so many pages have been written, and which this passage is said to allude to.

Τρεος tumr ὅι μαρτυρεντες εν τη γη, το πνευμοι nou το ὕδωρ, και το duaa. και ὀι τρεις εις το ἐν εισι. See
Epist. of St. John, ch. v. ver. 7. It proves, however, that the doctrine of the Trinity was
generally received about that period, and considered as a distinguissiing part of the Christian
creed, it would not otherwise have been taken notice of by our author. See Jup. Tragadus‚
cap. 41.

u Fam, &sq Alluding to the celebrated tetrachtys of Pythagoras. Thejudicative powers in
all things, says he, are four, mind, science‚ opinion, and sense3 for which reason (a strange
one to be sure), Pythagoras held that the soul of man was a tetrad. Every thing depends on
the tetrachtys, as irs root and principle, the word tetrachtys‚ therefore, was used by this philo-
sopher and his disciples as a great oath; his scholars swore, not by Pythagoras, but hythe
great person who communicated to them the tetrachtys. For a farther account of this, see
Stanley’s History of Philosophy, art. Pythagoras.

τι Meqsum'ng] Alluding to that passage in Aristophanes’s comedy of the Clouds, where So-
crates is introduced and ridiculed, as coniputing the different spaces which a flea passes over in

walking‚ leaping‚ &c-
