488 LAPITHAE,0RTHEBANQUET.

Thac, though much more Ι could have added, may suffice to shew you what
kind ofmm you have affronted‚ only to please Diphilus, whom you have
thought proper to entrust with the care of your son, and in this you are cer-
tainly right3 he has an extraordinary affection for the young man, and the
young man sor hiim if it were not for modesty's sake Ι could say something
more on this head, and which Zopyrus, the paedagogue, knows to be true·²
but Ι (10 not chuse to disturb the festival by accusations, especially of this
natur03 though Diphilus wcll deservcs it⁹ as he has already taken away two
scholars srom me3 but, sor the sake of philosophy, 1 say no more. I have or.
dered my servant, if your people offer him any x·i&ual-s, not to take any,
that you may not think l sent him for that purposc.''

it off ns well as he could. He whispered the servant to take care of him, and

a little after, Zeno got up, and ssunk off privately; the'school-master figni-
