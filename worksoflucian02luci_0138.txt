we found an old woman, sitting by a large fire, who took all the baggage,
and put it up for them; they aiked her why she sat there, and did not get
the supper ready; it is all ready, said she, there is bread, and good old wine,
and some flesti of wild beasts for you3 every thing in order. They thanked
the old woman, pulled off their cloaths, anointed themselves at the fire,
and as she had a cauldron of hot water ready, poured it out, and used it as
a temporary bath on the occasion. In a little time after, there arrived several
young men, with gold and filver, and snen’s and women’s apparel os various
kinds; these were all brought into the common stoek, and depofited here,
The men bathed: after this, there was a magnificent supper, and a long
conversation amongst the ruffians. The old woman provided barley for me
and the horse, who made all the haste he could to devour it, as fearingl
thfflld come in for a dinner with him. I never touched it, but whenever the
old woman turned her back, got to the bread which was in the house, and
eat it. Next day they all went out on their busmess, leaving me with the
old woman, and one young fellow. Ι lamented the stri& confinement, for
though I could have easily got away from the old woman, the young man
was very siout, and looked formidable, standing always at the gate with a
sword in his hand. About three days after, in the middle of the night, the
robbers came back, bringing nothing along with thern but a young and
beautiful virgin in tears, with her hair diffievelled‚ and garments almost torn
off her: they brought her in, desired her not to be frightened, and ordered
the old woman to stay with and take care of her. The girl would neither eat
nor drink‚ but wept, and tore her hair in such a manner, that even I, who
was standing at the manger, could not help ffiedding tears with her. The
robbers went to supper in an outer room. Towards morning, one of their
spies, whose business it was to look out sharp for the crew, cameto give them
notice, that a stranger who had a great deal of money with him, was to pass
by that way. As soon as they heard this, they rose immediately, took their
arms, and saddled both me and the horse, to go along with them. As Ι
knew 1 was going to a battle, 1 hung behind, and went on very ssowly, but
was soon made to mend my pace with a good club. When we came to the
place where the stranger was to pass, the robbers all russied upon the carriage,
ssew him and his servantS, and put all the booty which they got of great
valiae, upon the horse and me, hiding the rest of their spoil in the wood.
Thus loaded, we were returning horne, when besides, being beaten and
