oNcALUMNY. 373

ticing eloquence, for such we often meet with, of the informer ε the more
specious he appears, the more stri& should be our inquiry. We must not,
therefore, always give credit to the judgment, or rather the prejudice of the
accuser, but reserve to ourselves an examination into the truth‚ giving back
to the calumniator all his envy and hatred‚ bringing into open day-light the
real merit of every one, and at length bestowing our love or hatred accord-
ing to it. To do otherwise is mean, childish, and dishonest.

But the cause of all, as 1 said in the beginning, is our ignorance, and be·
cause the true chara&ers of men lay hid in darkness. Would τᾳ heaven some

god would open all our hearts! then would the light of truth irradiate every
objeen and calumny, driven to the deep abyss, no longer find an habitation
amongst‘the sons of rnen.
