SATURNALIA. 453

lagreed to take them myself‚ only to remind men how different life was
when Ι reigned 3 when every thing sprung up without ploughing or sowing;
when there were no ffieaves, but bread ready made, and flesh ready dreffed;
when there were rivers of wine, and fountains of milk and honey 3 for then
all was good, ‘and all was gold. This is the cause of my short-lived reign:
hence all this finging, playing‚ and dancing3 this equality between free-
men and ssaves; for, when 1 reigned, there was no servitude.

P R 1 E S T.
1 always thought you instituted this festival from a compaffionate regard

to those that wear chains, and with a kind of retrospec't to your own.

S A Τ U R N.
You will not leave off your jokes and sarcasms, then ?

Ρ R Ι Ε S T.
lwill, indeed: but, pray, answer me one question: in your reign, did

they use to play at dice?
S A T U R N.

Yes: but not for talents, or ten thousand drachmas, as they do now—a-
days ε they only played for nuts; so that he who lost never wept, and raved‚

or starved himself for grief.
P R I E S Τ.

Very true: what, indeed, should they play for, who were nothing but
gold? I was thinking, if one of these golden nien were to come now
amongst us, and live in these days, what a miserable condition would he be
in: they would fall upon and tear him in pieces, as the Maenades did Pen-
theus, the dogs Afitaeon, and the Thracian women poor Orpheus3 they
would quarrel amongst themselves, which should have the largest part of
him: for, even on these days of festivity, they are always intent on lucre,
and think of nothing else z even, at the banquet‚ some of them will thieve
from their friends, whilst *others are curfing you most impioussy, and break-
ing in pieces the innocent dice, for the faults which they themselves were
guilty of. Imust ask you one thing more, and that is, How it happens that
a tendet old man, like you, should chuse out this inclement season of the
year, when there is nothing but wind, ice, and snow every where3 when the
trees are withered and leafless, the fields without flowers oi· beauty ; and men,
contraued, as it were, with age, hang over the fite: how could you pick

out this time for a festival, which is agree-able neither to old nor young ?
