THE

DoussLE INDICTMENT,

ADIALOGUE.

This thle is taken from the latter part of the lillle Piece befhre us; where Locmx,
in a most ingenious Manner defends his own Method of [Vr-iting, agaiifi lhqfi’ Crini-s
⁴who blamed him for leaving Oratmy, Declamation, and Philofhphy, to sport iil lhe
more plecfing Walk of easy Dialogue. He ridie-ales the Logicicms, laughs at the
Epicuream, and diver-ts himfilf with the Platonic and Socratic Disputants. The

Plague on those philosophers, who say, that the gods alone enjoy true

with fire, and shin'mg with his rayS, runs about all day in his charior, from
one end of heaven to the other, and has not leisure, as they say, to scratch
his ears3 for, if he should stop but a moment, the horses would shake off
their bridles, turn out of the way, and set every thing on fire. Then observe
the Moon‚ how carefully she takes her round to light topers that recl home
late at night from supper. Then again, Apollo, who has taken a heavy tafk
upon him, is almost stunned with the noise of those that arc calling upon
him for divinations; now he is forced to go to Delphi, alittle after he posts
to ᾖ· Colophon, then, perhaps, crosses † Xanthus, and runs away in his

*¹ Colophon] A city near Claros in Ionia, where there was an oracle of Apollo. Potter cloes not,
