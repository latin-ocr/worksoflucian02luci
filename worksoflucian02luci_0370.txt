’ neb. Apelles the* Ephesiam hath drawn this picture before me: ‘ne was
unjustly accused of bearing a part in the conspiracy which Theodotus had
formed against † Ptolemy at Tyre, though he had never been at Tyre, or
knew any thing of 4³· Theodotus, any more than that he was a commander
under Ptolcrny‚ and had the care os Phoenicia entrusted to him. One Anti-
philus, a rival artist, who envied him, both for the excellency of his painting,
and ilie esteem in which he was held by the king, had, it seems, informed
Ptolemy, that he was prix-y to the transactiom that a person had seen him at
supper with Theodotus and Phaenice, and in close conference with him dur-
ing the whole entertainment‚ and that, in short, the defection of Tyre, and
the taking of Pelufium, were both owing to the counsel and affistance of
Apelles. Ptolemy‚ a man in other respeets not over-wife, and nursed up
from his infancy by that adulation which is generally bestowed on tyrants,
was so worked upon by this· improbable and absurd calumny‚ that, never
c ›nfidering within himself, that the accuser was one of his rivals, or how irn-
poffible it was for a poor painter to support such aconspiracy3 especially one
whom he had so highly favoured and preferred to all of his profeffion; with·
out even so much as enquiring whether Apelles had ever been at Tyre, grew
so exasperated‚ as to fill the whole palace with complaints of his ingratitude,
calling him a traitor and conspirat0r3 insomuch, that if one of those who
were taken up at the same time, struck with compaffion for Apelles, and de·
testing the impudent falsehood of Antiphilus, had not declared that he had
no concern in it, he would, probably, have lost his head, and paid, him-
self, the price of Tyrian perjury and falsehood. Ptolemy is said so severely
to have repented of his credulity, as to make Apelles a present ofa hundred
talents, and to have given Antiphilus to him as a ssave. Apelles, who long
bore in mind the danger he had been in, revenged the calumny against him
by a § picture which Ι shall here describe to you.

tegard to the defign and composition ; as such 1 would recommend it to the consideration of our

modern Apenes, my ingenious friend Mr. Benjamin West, who is capable of doingjuflice to such
a suffieit, and would execute it finely.
