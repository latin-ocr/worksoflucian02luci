This admirable scheme was received by· them with the highest approba-
tion. I lamented, as you may suppose, my inevitable fate3 not only that Ι
was to be killed, bur, even aster death, not suffered to lie peaceably down,
but condemned to be a sepulchre for the unhappy virgin.

It was now day-break, when, on a sudden, there russied in upon us a
band of soldiers, who had been sent to take up the robbers; all of whom they
immediately bound, in order to carry them before the governor. Amongst
our deliverers was a young man, beloved by, and who was soon to be mar·
ried to the beauteous captive; he it was, it seems, who had traced out, and

tress, to make me amends for all my trouble, requested it as a favour of her
father, and he ordered me to be turnedloose into the field, and to feed with
the mares: “ There, said he, you may live happily, and divert yourself with
them.'' He then called one of the shepherds, and gave me to his care. He
put me into grass among the mares, and happy Ι thought myself, that Ι was
to carry no more burthens. This reward was, doubtless, in the opinion or a
jack-ass‚ no contemptible one. The lady’s favour, however, proved fatal·
