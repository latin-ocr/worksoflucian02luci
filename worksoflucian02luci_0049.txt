him, for he was a Half-Grecian, yet he persec'tly nn1lc1slood him. XVhen
he was returning home, Nero embraced him, and desncd him to all< for
whatever he pleased, and he should have it: whereupon, the barbarian said,
The greatest favour you can confer, will be, to make me a present of that
dancer. And when Nero ass<ed what service he could bc os to hini, he
replied‚ Ihave several barbarians at horne, who speak different languagts,
and it is difficult to get interpreters for them: this man will supply the
place osone, and by his gestures explain every thing to me. So strong an
impreffion had this imitative art 'made on him, and so clear and excellent
did it appear to him.

The chief business and scope of this art consists, as Ι before observed, in
its imitative perfc&ion; the same which the rhetoricians aim at, particular-
ly those who excel in what we call declamation; which always meets with
extraordinary applause, when it is agreeable to the subjcet, and corresponds
with the chara&er of the person supposed to speak, whether he be a tyranr-
killer‚ a poor man, or a husbandman3 in either of these, the merit lies in
,representing what is proper for, and peculias to him.

, Ι will tell you what another barbarian said on this subject. Seeing one
day five masks prepared, (sor the fable confisted of five aets,) and but one
dancer, he enquired who was to perform the rest os the parts; and, being
informed that he was to do them all himself, ‘⁶ 1 did not know, said he, my
good friend, that this one body of yours had so many souls.”

The Romans have not improperly styled the dancer a ³⁶ pantomime, the
imitator of every thing, as he really is; the ⁹}- poetical exhortation, there-
fore, may be well applied to him3 ‘⁶ Frequent thou, my son, various cities
and various people, assuming their manners, and adhering, like the poly-

ὅθ Pantomimes] The mimics and pantornimes which Lucianhere speaks of, were not intro·
duced till in the decline of the Roman empire, when an almost total depravity of taste prevailed:
though dancers, they had their names from aeting or imitation, copying all the force ofthe
paffions, merely by motions of the body, and without the help of words, represented nli the
stories of antiquity. ’ They became so extremely fassiionable, and were so nniversally caress'cd
by the young nobility‚ thatalaw‚ we are told, was at last made, that no pantomime should be
suffered to enter the house ofa Patrician. See Weaver on Dancing‚ and the abbc'· du Bos.

The polypus here mentioned, was probably a kind of oyster or muscle, adhering to the rock,
