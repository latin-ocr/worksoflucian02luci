children for the truth of them, insomuch‚ that 1 fixed my eyes on him with
astonishment: sometimes 1 thought the man was not in his right mind, and
at others, that he was an impostor who had deceived me, or an ass in a lion’s
skin,= so very absurd and ridiculous were the stories which he told.

Pray, let us have them, for 1 should be glad to know what kind of folly
could lay hid under that great beard.

1 used frequently to visit him, and this morning wanting to meet Leon-
tichus, who, you know, is my old friend, and hearing by his boy that he
was gone to see Eucrates‚ who was fick‚ and which I had not heard of, I
nent to his house on purpose to meet them both there: when 1 carne, Leon-
tichus‚ they told me, was just gone, but there was a good deal of company
left, amongst whom I found Cleodemus' the Peripatetic, Dinomachus the
Stoic, and Ion, who, you know, is famous for his Platonic disputations, and
esteemed as thebest expositor of his master's tenet53 you see what venerable
company 1 had got into, men of the first rank for wisdom and virtue in their
several stols, and whose very countenances were awful and tremendous;
besides these, there was Antigonusthe phyfician, who, I suppose, had been
called in to give his advice in the disorder which Eucrates laboured under, ,
and which was growing better, as it was now getting down again into his
’θ feet: he spoke to me in a low voice, as if distempered, and defired me
to fit down by him on the bed, though, as Icame in, I thought 1 heard
him talking very loud: I took great care not to touch his feet, and after
making the usual excuse, that I did not know of his illness, but came as soon
as ever Idid, sat down by him; the company were all talking about his
distemper, and every one prescribing his own remedy for it: if, said Cleo—
dennis, you take up a weasel from the ground in your left-hand, killed in
the manner 1 mentioned, and wrap it up in the skin of a lion just flead, and
clap it to the leg, the pain will cease immediately3 not a lion's‚ said Dino-
machus, but, as I have heard, a young virgin hind: this, indeed, is the
most probable, because the hind is swift, and her strength lies in her feet:
alionis strong indeed, his fat, therefore, and his right paw, with some

ἃ Fam] Probably the gout, which, by all accounts, was as fashionable amongst the Greeks

and Romans as ourselves. The dispute between rhe two learned dodon, whether it was to be

cured hy the lion's or the ‘hind’s skin, ancl the reasons in favour of each are full of true hu-
mour.
