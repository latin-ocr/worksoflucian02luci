APOPHRAS. 379

tions in their language‚ but this phrase has always remained amongst them,
and has been used in that sense, and in that only, by every body. Ι could quote
a number of those who made use of it in former times, bnt that I would nor
trouble you with a list of poets, orator-s, and historians, whom yon know non
thing of: 1 need not mention who they are, for every body else is well ac-
quainted with them: if you can ssiew me one of them, who has not, Iwill
put up a statue of you at ἦ Olympia. He indeed, who knows not this,
cannot tell, I suppose, whether Athens is a city in Attica, Corinth in the
Isthmus, or Sparta in Peloponnesus.

But you will say, perhaps, you know the name well enough, but only
found fault with the wrong application of it3 we will take it up then on
this ground, and observe, unless, perhaps, you think it no disgrace to be
convicted of universal ignorance, how 1 will confute you. Is our ancestors
praitised the same method asI did, (for in every age there were impious and
abominable fellows like yourself,) if one man is called Cothurnus because
he is like a buskin, another ψ Lupae because he makes a noise and disturbs
the affembly, another Hebdomas because he laughs and plays at a public
mceting, like boys on the l seventh day of the mouth, why rnay not Ι, also,

ifl please, compare a wretch stained with every vice, to an inauspicious and
unfortunate day ? ·

If we rneet a man, especially when we first go out in the morning, who
is lame in his right foot, or if we come across an eunuch, or a monkey, we
turn home again as fast as we can, foreseeing that we can never be prosperous
on that day after such bad omens : andin like manner, at our first going ont
in the morning as it wereof the year, if we meet a pathic, doing and suf-
fering every thing that is base and infamous, one whom even his own depen„

Ἰ· Olympia.] The greatest honour which mere mortals could ever arrive at. To say a man

should have this, became by degrees a kind of proverbial expreffi0n.—Like, do this,
—- et eris mihi magnus Apollo.

{- Lupae.] Concerning the exa& signification of the Greek word Arm-am, here made use os,
the learned commentators are much divided : some are of opinion it was originally written
Λυσαην, quast, Λυσαης ανεμος, a stormy wind, to which a turbulent orator may properly be com-
pared. Others tellus that Avwm is a corruption by the transcribere» 01⁴ Λυσσαν, furoris genus, a
kind of madness, (which is rather the more probable conjee'hire) ς the Latin transsator, there<
fore interprets it rabiem. It may suffice, however, for the English reader to know, thar luffa
fignifies something noisy and violent.

ζ cheuth day.] Greek, εξδομην. The seventh day of every mouth was observed as a festi-
val, or kind of holiday, sacred, we are told, to Apollo, who was born on the serenth of the

month Thurgalion.
