TnzFALsEPROPHET. '2‘3

ander, and not the prophet. He bore it, however, very patientlm called
offthe attendants, and promised he would soon find the means of reconciling
me to him, and would shew me the power of Glycon, who could make the
bitterest enemies friends to each other. Then commanding all that were
present to retire, he began to expostulate with me, saying‚ he knew me
very well, and what Ι had said to Rutilianus about him: And why, added
he, would you a& thus, when you know how it is in my power to advance
you by his means? Knowing the dangerous fituation Ι was in, l thankcd
him for his civility, and withdrew. And sowe parted friends, to the no
small astonishment of many who wondered to see rne come off so well.

Soon after this, when I was going to set fail, (for only Xenophon and my-
self were left behind, my father and family being gone before to Amastris,)
Be sent me several presents, and even went so far as to offer me a ssiip and
rowers to carry rne over. Ι, thought he meant me fair in all this, but
when we were got half way„0bserving the pilot in team, and quarrelling
with the sailors, I‘began‘to suspect something wrong. Alexander, stseems,
had given ordersthat they should seize and throw us all over-board, which,

and will not after alhdip my hands in blood.’' He then told us Alexandcr⁷5>
eommands, and what he was to have done with us.-

When they had landed us at AEgiale, celebrated b'y the noble “lv Homer,
they returned home. Herel met with some Bosphoran ambaffadors, who
had been sent by king Eupator into Bithynia to receive the annual tribute,
and told thern the danger we had been- in; they treated us kindly, took us
into their {hip; and thus I got safe to Amastris, after our narrow escape.
From this time 1 strained every nerve to be revenged on that rascal, whom,
before the vile snare which he laid for me, Ialways abominated‚ on account
of his infamous charaEter.· Issnow determined on a public accusation of him,
in which I was supported by many, and more especially by those philoso-
phers who were disciples of Timocrates the Heracliot. But this was put a
stop to by the king of Pontus and Bithyniaswho almost on his kncet {numn-
