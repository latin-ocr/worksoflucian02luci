still bad with the wounds he had received, made his way> to the city, and
told his comrades what had happened to him, with the insolence of the gar-
dener3 they immediately joined with him, and taking some persons sent by
the magistrates along with thern, endeavoured to find out where we were:
they came to the house, and one of the Officers commanded all that were
within to corne forth, they appeared, but no gardener with thern: the sol-
dier infisted on it that the gardener was there, and his ass also: they, on the
other hand, affirmed that there was neither ass nor man left behind: the
street being but narroxv, and a great noise and riot made in it, Iwho arn na-
turally impatient, and had great curiosity, wanting to know what they cried
out about, got to the window and looked down upon then] ε some observed
me, and told the rest, and said it must be a lie: the magistrates at length
came, and found out every thing, discovering my master lying in the chest,
and sent him to prison, to be called to account for his insolence. 1 was made
a present of to the soldiers. They were all ready to die with laughing at the
ass on the top of the house, who betrayed his master; and from thence
sprang the proverb, when a rnan squints, they say, he looks from an asS.
What became of my master, the gardener, I know not, but the next day
the soldier sold me for five and twenty attic drachmas ε the man who bought
me was servant to a rich grandee of Thessalonica, one of the largest cities in
Macedonia: he was a kind of house-steward, and with his brother, who
lived also in the family, prepared every thing for his master's table. These
two lodged in the same house, and joined stocks together, one baking the
bread, and the other making up sweet-rneats, and dainties of every kind:
after their master had supped, they used to bring home the relicks, fifh,
flesh, and all forts of niceties. Joining to the apartment where they were
put, was my stable, and 1 was left there as a guard, and locked in with the
provifion. 1 bad farewel, therefore, to my barley, fell foul upon my mas-
ter‘s dainties, and, after a long fasting, got a good belly-full of human
food. ‘When they returned horne they ha‘d for some time no suspicion of
what had paffed3 there was, indeed, such plenty, that what I took was
never miffed, besides, that at first Ι made my depredations very sparingly,
and with great cantion ; but after this, laughing at them for fools, Inot only
devoured as much as I pleased, but picked out the nice bits, when at lengthv
they found they had been plundered, though they could not tell by whom,

and began to suspeit, and abuse each other, for seizing on the common

stock, which from that time they carefully divided. I ,
