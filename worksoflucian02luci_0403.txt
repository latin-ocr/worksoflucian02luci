must call in history to refntr th: opinion ftliosa· who finnl fault with our air
as unwholcsorne, and which fleuters us with [lie plcafizvg hope thar our
prayers will be crowned with success, and that the * lord of earth mul (eas,
who is already far advanced, will long rule over this land, and arr [in to a
great and happy old age¹ Arganthonius, king of the Tartcffisms, limi a
hundred and fifty years, as we lcarn from Herodotus the historiari, aud [lic
poet Anacreon3 though by some the aczount is deenied fabulous. Demo-
chares and Timaeus tell us, that Agathocles, king of Sicily, died at ninetjc-
five; we are informcd likewise by Demetrius and others, that Hiero lived n)
ninety -two‚ after a reign of sev enty years. ἧῃῐεειε, king of Scythia, died it
ninety‚ fighting against Philip, on the banks of the Isthcr And Bardylig

sovereign of the Illyrians, is said to have fought on hoiseback at the same
age3 and Teres, king ofthe Odrysians, as † Theopompus tells us, died at
ninety—two. Antigonus Cocles, king of Macedonia, and son of Philip, fell
in the battle with Seleucus and Lyfimachus, covered with wounds, when he
was eighty one years old, as we are informed by Hieronymus, who accompa-
nied him in that expedition, and who tells us also, that Lysimachus, king*
ofthe Macedonians, fell in the war against Seleucus, when he was just four-
score. Antigonus, son of Demetrius, and nephew of the one-eyed Antigo-
nus, ruled orer Macedon four-and-forty year5‚ ant] lived to eighty, accord-
ing to Medius and other writers; and Antipater, the son of Iolaus, a man
of great power and authority, who was governor to many of the kings of
Macedon, died upwards of eighty. Ptoleniy of Lagus, the most prosper-
ous prlnce of his time, poffeffed the kino t>don] of Egypt to the ei rhty —fourthv
year ofhis age, and two years before he died, r'efigned it to his son Ptolemy
Philadelphus, the only child who survived him. Philotaurus, the eunuch,
the first who acquired the kingdom of Pergamus, held it for 3 long time,
and died at fourscore3 and Attalus, surnamed Philadelphus, another king
of the same place, who xwas vifired by Scipio the Roman general, lived to
the age of eighty-two. NIithridates, king of Pontus, surnamed the Builder,
died, after his flight from Antigonus, at eighty· four, as Hieronymus and
other writers inform us. The same historiari says that Ariarathes, king of
[he Cappadocians, lived eighty two years, and might probably have snr-

‘ Lor qu'the eard, &c .] A pretty high strained compliment3 but we must remember' ι
aas paid to an emperor.
