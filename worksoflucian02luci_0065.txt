The Greeks tell a thousand other stories, which Ido not intirely be·-

Jupiter; Ascalaphus, of Mars3 and Autolychus, of Mercury? all os them,
indeed, were beloved of the gods; Venus beheld one, Jupiter another, and

Mars another, at their ⁷⁷⁶· nativity: for which soever god prefidcd at the

⁹ Nativigy] This is the foundation, as it were, and corner-stone of astrology; calling nati-
vities hasbeen praffised in almost every age and nation, from the times of Lucian even to this
day. Amongst us, this ridiculous science flourished greatly during the reigns of the Stuarts,
and even at a later period. Some of our greatest men were weak enough to consult astrologers,
and to listen to their predistions. Amongst these a story is told of Dryden which, as it is
a pretty extraordinary one, 1 shall here subjoin for the entertainment of my readers.

‘⁶ Dryden, with all his understwdiuss, was weak enough to be fond of judicial astrology,
and used to calculare the nativity of his children. When his lady was in labour of his son
Charles, he, being told it was decent to withdraw, laid his watch on the table, begging one of
the ladies, then present, in a most solemn manner, to take exa& notice of the very minute the
child was born, which she did, and acquainted him with it. About a week after, when his
lady was pretty well recovered, Mr. Dryden took occasion to tell her that he had been calculat-
ing the child’s nativity‚ and observed, with grief, that he was born in an evil hour, for Jupiter,
Venus, and the Sun, were all under the Barth, and the lotd of his ascendant afflified with a
hateful square of Mars and Saturn. If he lives to arrive at the eighth year, says he, he will
go near to die a violent death on his very birth-day, but if he should escape, as I see but small
hopes, he will in the twenty-third year be under the very same evil «medion, and if he should
escape that also, the thirty-third, or thirty-fourth is, I sear—here he was interrupted by the
immoderate griefof the lady, who could no longer hear such calamity prophefied to befall her son.
The time at last came, and August was the inauspicious month, in which young Dryden was
to enter into the eighth year of his age. The court being in progress, and Mr. Dryden at
leisure‚ he was invited to the country-seat of the carl os Berksnire, his brother-in-law, to keep
the long vacation with him in Charlton in Wilts; his lady was invited to her uncle Mordaunt‘s‚
to pass the remainder of the summer! When they came to divide the children. lady Elizabeth
would have him take John, and‘suffer her to take Charles3 but Mr. Dryden was too absolute,
and they parted in anger3 he took Chatles with him, and ssie was obliged to be content with
John. When the fated day came, the anxiety of the lady's spirits occasioned such an efferres}
cence of blood, as threw herinto so violent a sever, that her life was despaired of, till a letter
came from Mr. Dryden, reproving her for her womanilh credulity, and assuring her that her
child was well, which recovered her spirits, and in fix weeks aster lhe received an ecclairciffe-
ment of the whole affair. Mr. Dryden, either through sear of being reckoned superstitious, or
thinking it a science beneath his study, was extremely cautious of letting any one know that he
was a dealer in astrology.; therefore could not excuse his absence, on his son's :umii‘ersary⁸
from a general hunting match lord Berkshire had made, to which all the adjacent gentlemen
were invited. When he went out, he took care to set the boues a double exorciso in the Latin
