—These things, young man, if you diligently observe (and they are very
eafily done), 1 will answer for it, in a short time, you will be the best
orator in the world, and as great as myself3 the consequenceI need not:
point out to you, nor the many advantages which eloquence has to bestow;

writers, for those advocates, who had gained their cause, to hang up green branches and
crowns besore their doors, in token of their success, which Juvenal {illudes to,

ut tibi lasso
Figantur virides, scalarum gloria palmae.
And Martial also, in the following lines,
