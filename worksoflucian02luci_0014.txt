BALEXAND‘Emon,

other men are, but twice botn3 and hatched‚ not froma 4 crow, by heaven,
but from a goose.

The people followed him, seeming, as it were, inspired, and filled
with a religious phrenzy, beyond all conception. He stayed at home
some days, flatterimg himself that, as it afterwards proved, the re-
port of this would draw the Paphlagonians to him in great numbers;
and accordingly, when the city was as full as it could hold, of crea-
tures without heads or hearts‚ who resembled men only in their form,
and in every thing else were more like sheep, he sat himself down in a
little house on a bed, cloathed in a most magnificent habit, as became a
god3 and there took in his lap the great beautiful Pellaean AEfculapius which
I mentioned some time ago, and lapping it quite round his neck, the tail
sticking out at bettoni, (for it was so large, that part of it might lay in his
bosom, and the other part drag on the ground‚) hid only the head under his

arm-pits, when at length the linen one peeped out from beneath his gar-
mem, as ifit belonged to the serpent.

Imagine to your-sels a house of no great note, with scarce room to let the
light in, crouded with people already amazed and almost out of their senscs
with strong hopes and expectatimus, to whom, not without reason, the affair
must have seemed wonderful3 with what astonishment did they behold this
serpent to all appearance grown to such a fize in a few days, quite tame and
gentle, and with a head like a man's! before they had half seen it, driven
out and preffed by the croud of new admirers coming in upon thern, for
there was another door on the opposite fide, like that which the Macedonians
made, as they tell us, when Alexander the Great was fick, and every body
crouded in to see and take their last leave of him. This shew the rogue ex-
hibited very often, and especially when any rich strangers came into the city.

To say the truth, my dear Celsus, the people of Pontus and Paphlagonia,
a stupid and illiterate racc of men, are very excas-able, if, after touching the
serpent, (which Alexander permitted them to d0‚) and seeing it by a faint
and glimmering light open and shut its mouth in that manner, they were de-
ceived. The trick indeed required a Democrates, an Epicurus, or a Me-
trodorus, some man of a firm and penetrating mind, who after casting about

the Greek lignifies also a crow,) who was the mother ofAEsculapius.
