ALEXANDER:
OR,
THEFALSE PRbPHET.

Though this is not the mqli humorous or witty, it is perhaps one of the mcst entertain-
ing Pieces of Luem« ; containing an exa& and probably true Account of a mest
extraordinasy Charafier who figured in his Time, and of whose tstOJzffhifzg Frauds
and Impcstures he was cm Eye—witncss. We cannot read it without wondering at ⁷
the Credulity of Mankind in the days of Paganism: nor, al the fizme time} without
rgflefi‘ing‚ that as glaring Frasca‘f, and as impudent Impositions‚ luz-ve been praffg'sqa'
by the Charch of Rome, even in the enlzghtened AEra of Christianity.

Y OU thought, perhaps, rny dear Celsus, the talk a very light and easy
one, when you commanded me to write the history of Alexander of
ἐγ Abonotichos ; his various schemes, tricks‚ and enterprizes : I affure yop,
to relate thern all with accuracy and preclfion‚ is as difficult as to describe the
afflons of the great 'l son of Philip. One was as remarkable for his knaoery,
as the other for his virtues. lf, nevertheless, .y0u will pardon my ersom,
and supply my deficiencies, I will endeavour to cleanse this Augaean stable :
not that Ι propose sweepingthe whole, but only to bring you a few basszem

ἃ Lauder and Bower.
