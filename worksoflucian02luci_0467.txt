SATURNALIA. 461

for their aukward behaviour, to be voted the best of prefidents yourself, and
receive the honour due: is not all this glorious? to be declared king os the
feast, to command, and not be commanded3 to make whom you please
abuse themselves, dance naked about the mom, or ³²²¹ go round the house
with a musician on his shoulders; are not these most illustrious privileges in
my gift? If you obje& that they are not solid 'and lasting, you should re-
member also, that my own empire is of very short duration. To these, how—
ever, which are in my power, you are welcome; ask boldly for them, 1
shall not frighten you with my aegis or my thunder.

PRIEST.

But these, O first of Titans, I really do not want : however, if you will
answer rne one question, which, above all things I wish to be resolved in,
I {hall think it a sufficient return for all my‘sacrifices, and forgive you every

thing else.
S A T U R N.

Ass< it, and if1 can, I will answer you.

Isit true then, which Ι have so often heard, that you used to devour the
children which you had by Rhea ; that she stole away Jupiter from you and

hid him, putting a stone in the room of him, which you swallowed ς that
when he was grown up, he conquered, and drove you out of your kingdom,
put you and all your allies in chains, and threw you into Tartarus?

SATURN.

If this was not a holy-day, when servants are at liberty to get drunk and
ψ abuse their masters 3 I would have shewn you that I had a right to resent
this treatment, and punish you for affronting thus, an old hoary god like me.

’Ἢ Go round, δικ] These, we are to suppose, were some of the pranks played at the Saturna· ·

lia, when the king of the feast, who was always obeyed, made every body do what he liked. We
have a custom of the same nature in the play of forfeits, when the keeper‚ or distributer ofthem
commnnds the forfeiter to do any ridiculous thing he thinks proper. Ineed not tell my fair rea-
ders that at these Saturnalia, no orders, how absurd soever, are to be disputed.

Ἄ· Αῶιςίέ, &aJ The custom, asin the Saturnalia, of establilhinga kind ofuuiversal liberty,
when servants had a licence to abuse their masters, usurp their authority fora time, δίς. seems to
have been adopted, atleast in some measure, by all natione : there are traces ofit in our own,
more especially in schools, colleges‚and foundations, ofwhich the Tripos verses in the univeriity of
Cambridge, well known to my fellow collegians, may be brought as an iustance; my brother
VVestminsters, of St. Peter’s college, will also recollec‘t the custom of eockzmonitor, διε. still, Ι

believe, preserved ainongst them.
