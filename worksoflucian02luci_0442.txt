ing taken care, beforehand, to let his hair grow, and put on a dirty gown,
with a club in his hand, and a satchel hanging down, his whole appearance
being truly tragic,) presented himself to the people, and told them that he
meant to throw all the estare of his late father, of happy memory, into the
public treasure. No sooner were the populace acquainted with this, than,
like poor creaturos always gaping after presents, they cried out immediately,
thar he was the friend of wisdom, the lover of his country, and the only rival
of Crates and Diogenes. The mouths of his enemies were stopped at once,
and if any man attempted to mention the murther, they took up stones and
pelted him. Once more, however, he was obliged to fly his country3 the
Christians were again his resource, and having entered into their service, he

and many other freaks still more extraordinary, he played for some time.
From thence, he passed over into Italy, where he abused every body he came
near, and particularly the emperor, who, he knew, was of so mild and
gentl: a nature, that he might do it with impunity, which made him more
bold and impudent. The prince cared very little for his abuse, and thought
ir, with-al, by no means becoming‚ to punish a man who had the appearance
of a philosopher, for a few foolish words; especially one whose νῖν profeffion
it was to deal ont obloquy and flander. This rather increased his reputati0n;
