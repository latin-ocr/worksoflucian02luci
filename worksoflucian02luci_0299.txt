ANACHARSIS. 293

As you propose, before your return home, to vifit the other parts of
Greece, you will not, Ihope, when you corneto Lacedaemon, laugh at, or
condemn the Spartans, for frequently killing one another about a ball, or
for affembling together in a little issand, surrounded with water, where the
Lycurgeans and Herculeans attack furioussy, and throw each other into
the river: after which, a peace succeeds, and they are all good friends again,-
nor, above all, must you be offended when you see their ³* young men whipped
at the altar, and streaming with blood; whilst their fathers and mothers
stand by, intreating them to suffer it courageoussy‚ and even proceed to
threats, if they do not bear it with patience and resolution: many have died
under this discipline, rather than acknowlege themselves unequal to it before
their friends and relations. Statues of these have frequently been ereffi‘oed at
the public expence. Think not, therefore, that they are out of their senses,
because, neither forced by their enemies, nor at the command of a tyrant,
they submit to such punishments. Their law-givcr, Lycurgus, would give
you very good reasons for it; would tell you, that he does not thus chastise
thern from hatred or cruelty, but with intent, that those who are to defend
their country, may be endowed with extraordinary patience, and be superior
to all pain and afflietion. But, without Lycurgus's apology, you must,
yourself, naturally conclude, that one of these young rnen would never re-
veal a secret prejudicial to his country, though the enemy should torture
him everso severely, but rather provokc a repetition of the strokes, and try
who should be tired first.

Was Lycurgus himselfwhipped thus when he was a youth, or, being pass'ed

the whippffig, did he safely and securely enjoin this discipline to be prafitised

by others? ἡ

NVhen he made these laws he was an old man, andjust returned ,from
Crete, whither he had travelled, on account of the excellent statutes which
he had heard were established there by Minus the son of Jupiter.

And why do not you irnitate LycurgUS, and flog your young rnen ? it is a
noble custom, and worthy of you.

⁸ Toung mem] The Spartan custom ofwhipping their boys at the altar of Diana, is taken

notice of by Pausanias, and by Plutarch in his life of Lycurgus. S O L O N
