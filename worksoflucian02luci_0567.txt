PHILOPATRIS. 561

0 TrIephon, we are fallen on happy times. 1 knew not what, when 1
died, to leave my children, forI am no stranger to your poverty‚ nor you
to mine: but the life of one ’(- emperor will now be enough for them ; never
{hall we want riches while he survive& nor {hall any nation be able to ter-

rify or alarrn us.'

And 1, Critiae-will bequeath to my children, the happiness of seeing
Babylon destroyed, and AEgypt subje& to the Roman yoke,

And Perfia’s sons in 0}- chains of servitude,

the Scythians repulsed3 would I could say, totally subdued. Mean time,
let us, with hands stretched out to heaven, return thanks to the unknown
God of Athens, that we are thought worthy of being subje&s of so excel-
lent a monarch. Let them go on with their follies, and rest contented with
the old proverb, ‡ All this is nothing to Hippoclydes.

θ* One emperor] What emperor this was, we know not ; some say one and some another.
For a solution of this difficulty, Ι must therefore refer my readers to the above mentioned dispu-

tation, whenever it shall be written: in the mean time, in complirnent to the learned Gesner,
let the honour, if you phease, remain with Julian.
