Tru'e: but this is the busmess of rhapsodists, and heroic writers : 1 am no

poet; 1 shall only spoil the business, by ex'ceeding the measure of the verse,
or patching it up when it falls short, and they will laugh at ine sor my ig-
norance: I have seen Apollo himself scrved so, for some of his oracles:
though the obscurity of the prophecy hides a great many saluts, and the
hearer is feldom at leisure to examine the mette.

You may give it us out of Homer ; call the council as he has done, 1 snp-

Not exaftly, Ῑ arn afraid: I will try, however, what 1 can do,

let the works of Phidias, Alcamenes, Myron, Euphranor, and the like ex-
cellent artists, have the preference: as rothe vulgar, that are poorly exe-
cuted, they may stand silentiu a corner, as only admitted to fill up the

with it. The idea of calling on the νωνυμες, the sme nomine turba, or gods without a name, is
truly laughahle.

-{- Materials] The real gods affembled in heaven, are supposed to call on their representa-
tives on earth, the statues in brass, gold, ὅτε. to join the council‚ and be acquainted with the
dangers that threatened the whole community; hence arises a ridiculous distinstion and dispute
foncerning the several materials of which the deities were made, with which Lucian makes him-

self extremely merry.
