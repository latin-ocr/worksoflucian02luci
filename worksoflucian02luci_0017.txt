curing pains and bruises‚ made of bears fat. The questions about future
good fortune, treasures‚ and estates in expectance, 116 always deferred giv.
ing answers to, and took care to add, “ these things shall come to pass is 1
please, and if my prophet Alexander asks it os me, and puts up his prayer
for you.’'

The stated ’ price for every answer from the oracle was one '³4 drachma and
two oboli. Do not imagine, my friend, that this was a small consideration,
for he took seventy or eighty thousand every year, giving the same people
sometimes ten or fifteen answerS, such was their insatiablc defire of learching
into futurity. The profit indeed, was not entirely his own, nor did he ssorc
it all up3 but as he had many affistants, under—workmen, spies, writers, and
keepers of the oracles, interpreters, sealers, &c. he divided to every one his
portion, according 10- their merits. ,

Resides these, he sent emissaries into foreign countries, to support the re-
put‘ation of his oracle, and give out how it could (161661 fugitives, convici:
thieves and robbers, discover hidden treasures, heal the fick, and even some-
* times call the dead to life again. This made thern croud to him from every
part: hence arose gifts, and sacrifices, and a double see to him as prophet
and disciple, or favourite of the deity3 for this decree had been carefully

dispersed abroad, as from the god,
Remember, ye my minister obey‚

To him respect and due obedience pay,
Nor fame, nor riches‚ my affections share,

My faithful prophet 15 my only care.
At length, several men of sense and understanding, recovered asir were

from their drunken fit, made a stand against him, the principal of whom

were followers of ἦν Epicurus, who by degrees found out the whole appara-
tus, and discovered all his tricks. These he opposed, by throwing outa

Ἃ One Drachma, &cd About nine pence half-penny. Few of our fortune-tellers are so rea·
sonable in their demands. The number of custmners, however, according to Luc-ian, made

ample amends for the smallness of the present.

sense‚) the avowed enemies osoracles and divinations; and even in 1116 times of their greatest
influenee and power, frequently and openly derided them. With these, Luci-an tells us, the
Christiane. joined, as it might naturally be supposed they would, as it became 1116 opposers of
error, fraud, and chicanery. These gross impofitions on the credulity of mankind were 11011
on the decline. It is not improbable, but that this little mirarive of Luciazi'S, contributas 111

some measure towards their total overthrow.
