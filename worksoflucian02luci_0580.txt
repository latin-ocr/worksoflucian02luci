574 NER0;0R‚'‘THE1STHMUS·

ready firmly persuaded that the Muses could not {ing sweeter than himself;
his ambition was to be crowned sor his verses at the Olympic games, the
greatest and most honourable seat of renown; as to the Pythian, he thought
they more properly belonged to himself than to Apollo, who, in finging and

playing on the harp, was by no means able to contend with him. The
Isthmus was not amongst those schemes which he had premeditated‚ but

happening to see the place, he was struck with the magnificence of it, and
calling to mind the P Grecian king¹ at the {iege of Troy, who divided Eu-
boea from Boeotia by the Euripus; and that Darius, when he went against the
Scythians, made a bridge over the Bosphorus, not forgetting the noble exploit
of Xerxes : add to this, that he thought the making such a communication
would be a high treat to the Grecians. lt is the nature of tyrants, however
intoxicated with power, to be fond of public applause. Coming out ofhis tent,
therefore,he sung a hymn to Neptune and Amphitrite, with a small ode in praise
of Melicerta and Leucothoe : then receiving a golden spade from the Gre-
cian president, -he approached towards the Isthmus, amongst the fhouts and
applauses ofthe multitude, and striking the earth three times, he exhorted
those to whom the care of the work was committed to go on with it as fast as
possible 3 and then returned to Corinth, thor01³g}:².7.=· iliriffied, no doubt, that
he had exceeded all the labours of Hercules-1 ηῗ ,ίὲῑωηγ and more labo-
rious parts were done by the ssaves, the revel and efy fell to the lot of
his soldiers: about the twelfth day, as we were in the midst of our work,
a rumour was spread that the emperor had changed his mind, and would not
have it done-‚ the AEgyptians, it was sulti, had measurcd the height of the
two seas, and discovered that one was lonver than the other·‚ they were afraid,
therefore, that the issand of AEgina would be overflowed : but the wjse
Thales himself, who had the deepest knowlege of nature, would never have
diffuaded Nero from cutting away the Isthmus, which he had set his beart
upon, even more than on finging in public; it was an insurrection of the
East, and the attempt of vl* Vindex, to establifh a commonwealth, which
drove him out of Greece‚ and put an end to his cutting the Isthmus, though
he talked ridiculoussy about measuring the two seas, which, to· my know-
lege were both of an equal height; but his power and that of Rome they
say is falling off, as you heard yesterday from the tribune,

⁸ Grecian king] 1 do not remember that this circumstance is mentioned by Homer, or any
other author now extant.
