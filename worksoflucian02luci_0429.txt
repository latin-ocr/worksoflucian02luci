THnWISHES. 423

A D 1 Μ A N T U S.
Lycium, you are always teizing me, and finding fault: Ideclare, you
{hall not have the chaise I ordered for you.

L Y C 1 N U S.
Aye : that is like the rich, promise and disappoint. But now, Samippus,

for yourwish.
S A M Ι P P U S.

1 am an inland man, an Arcadian, as you well know, from Mantinea. Ι
ssiall not wish for alhip, therefore3 which, if Ι had, l could not shew to
my fellow-citizens: nor will I ask for such trifling things as riches‚ 0f the
gods3 (Timolaus has told us they can do all thingS‚ and will deny us no-
thing3 according to his plan we are to ask for what we please :) I am re-
solved, therefore, to be a king3 not such a one as Alexander, or Ptolemy,
or Mithridates, or any of those who inherited kingdoms from their fathers:
I would begin, from ''⁴‘' rapine and plunder, with twenty or thirty brave and
faithful companions ; by degrees, three or four hundred more shall join us3
then a thousand ; and soon after ten thousand ; till at length 1 had got fifty
thousand armed men, and five thousand horse: then would Ι be chosen una-
nimoussy their commander, as a person most able to rule aud dire& every,
thing. Thus raised, by my merit, to the supremacy, Ῑ should be mnch
above other kings, not heir to another who had acquired the kingdom
for me. This would be equal to all Adimantus's treasures; nor can any

thing be so defireable as to gain an empire for one’s self.
L Y C I N U S.
This is, indeed, Sariiippus, the summit of all earthly happiness3 to have

the command of so many brave men, and to be deemed the worthiest by

fifty thousand warriors. We never imagined that Mantinea could ever have

produced so admirable a sovereign. Take poffeffion of your empire, lead
on your soldiers, caparison your horseS, and prepare your {hield—bearers : Ι
⁷ long to know which way your Arcadians are to go, or what poor wretcheg

you mean to fall upon first.
S A M Ι P P U S.

I-Iear me, Lycinus3 or, rather, if you will, sollow me : for I ssiall make

you captain of a troop of five thousand horse.

a· Rapina] This conveys to us a true idea os the ambitious man: it is not the in'neiiring,
but acquiring a kingdom, by means just or unjust, which will give him satisfat'tion. Crom-
well had much more pleasure in the usurpation of sovereign power, than his son ever enjoyed

in succeeding to it. L
