CHARIDEMUS. 569

“ W'hen Europe first came forth against Asia, and the war with Troy was
deelared, the Trojans, had they restored Helen, might have lived in peace3
if Greece had not contended for her, she might have been freed from
all her toils and dangers; but neither of them thought they could sight in a
nobler cause, than for the possession of her: the gods themselves, nor only
permitted, but even pressed their sons to engage in the war, though they
foreknew that they must per-ish in it, thinking it not less glorious to die sor
Helen, than to be descended from the immortals: but why need 1 mention
their sons, when they themselves, for her sake, entered into a more terrihle
war than that which they waged against the giunt53 there they were united,
burin this they fought against each other, an unanswerable proof how su-
perior beauty is to every thing else in the-opinion of the gods: for nothing
else did they ever quarrel among themselves, whilst for this alone, they not
only sacrificed their own offspring, but fought against each other, and were
wounded, is it not plain that they preferred beauty to every other confider-
ation ?

“ But, to dwell no longer on this head, let us call to mind the astonishing
beauty of *³* Hippodamia, the daughter of Oenomaus, how many noble
youths preferred death, to life without her ! WVhen this lovely virgin grew
up to be marriageable, her father so admired 'ner extraordinary beauty‚ that,
contrary to the dietates of nature, he became deeply cnamoured with her,

, and wishing to keep her to himself, to avoid suspicion, he gave out (a false-
hood as insamous as his guilty paffion), that he was ready to bestow her on
him who should best deserve her3 to carry on his purpose, therefore, he con-
trived, with the greatest art and labour, a charior, so formed as to move
with wonderful celerity, andjoined to it the swiftest horses in Arcadia3 in
this he contended with her admirers, laying it down as a condition, that
whoever conquered him should have his daughter, but if they failed, they
were to suffer death; obliging her at the same time to accompany every one
of thern in the ehariot, that their eyes being fixed upon her whilst they
drove, they might be careless and inattentive. The first lover falling in his
attempt, and >lofing both his mistress and his life, the rest of them, ashamed
to‘decline the contest, :md detesting the cruelty of Oenomaus, rufhed with
ardour, one after another, upon their fate, as if they wished to sacrifice their

'¹‘ Hippodamia.] This story is interesting, and well told by Lucian ς the same tale is related
by Philostratus. .
