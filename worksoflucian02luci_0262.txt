256 THEPARASITE.

son who posseffes them ; whereas, in the parasite, if the rules are not put iri
praffice, it makes an end both of the art and the artificer. As to the use-
fulness of the end required, it would be madness to call it in question: for
surely nothing is more useful than eating and drinking, as without thern, it
is impoffible to live.

True.

Again, it is not a gift of nature, like strength, or beauty‚ but acquired,
and consequently an art.

T Y C H I A D E S.
Right.
S I M O.

Neither is it ignorance, for ignorance can never serve or affist you: were
you to go to sea in a storm, and knew not how to guide the ihip, could you'

expe& to be saved ?
Τ Y C H 1 A D E S,

Certainly, no,
S Ι M O.

And wherefore? because, doubtless, you wanted the art.

TYCHIADES.

True.
S Ι M O.

The parasite, therefore, could not be saved if he was ignorant.

TYCHIADES.
Right. S I M O.

He is saved, therefore, by art, and not by ignorance.

TYCHIADES·

No doubt of it.
S Ι Μ Ο.

Parasitism, then, must be an art.

T Y C H Ι Α D E S·

So, indeed, it should seem to be.

S I Μ Ο,

Morem-er, very good pilots‚ and very good drivers have 1 seen thrown
from their seats, some bruised, others killed3 but never did lihear of a pa-
rafite wreeked or ,overturned Upon the whole, then, fince parafitism is
not‘ignorance, nor a gift of nature, bnt certain· fixed and approved rules re·
duced to praefice, be it agreed, henceforth‚ between us, that it is an art.
