not fail but you wilt find enough to imitate their conduct. Look back οτι
what is paffed, and judge whether it would be to your advantage to call iz>
any more such guests as Pylades and Orestes. If the rcss os your divinities
should be carried off in the same manner, you will soon be left without any
gods at all, and you must make them of those very men who came to dc-
prive you of your deities. Formerly you would not own them for divinum,
but now you sacrifice to them, and offer up victims to those who were very
near being victims themselves. This appears to me, Iown, truly ridicu-
lous, and beyond all example.

What they did at that time Ι think great and noble, for s0, in my opi-
nion, it was. To attempt such 'an undertaking, to sail so far from their
own country, through seas unknown and untried by any Grecians except
those who went to Colchis, not terrified by the reports of its being an in-
hospitable climate, inhabited by savage nations ι to behave so bravely whe'n
taken, and, not content with escaping from us, to revenge the injuries they
had received on our tyrant, and bear away the goddess with them, surely
these were deeds truly admirable, and worthy of divine honours. But
know, my friend, it is not for this alone we look upon Pylades and Orestes

as oui· greatest heroes. ξ ξ

Let me know, then, what they ever did befides which was so wonderful
and god-like: for, as to their ssdss in navigation, I can ffiew you some mer-
chants‚ who are much more divine voyagers than either of them ; particularly
amongst the Phoenicians‚ who will not only sail to Pontus, Maeotis, and Bos<
phorus, but through the Greek and Barbarian sea; who run over the whole
coast every year, and return home at the latter end of it: these you may

’ just as well make gods of, though three parts of them are no better than

victuallers and fishmongets.

Mark, now, my friend, how much better judges of good men we Bar·
barians are than you. Neither at Argos or Mycenae is there any monument
to Pylades or Orestes, whilst we have ereeted a temple, offer sacrifice, and
pay every honour to them both, as friends· and companionS. Nor because
they were strangers did Scythia esteem them less worthy of her notice: we
never ask of what country a good man is, nor, if they have done noble ac·
