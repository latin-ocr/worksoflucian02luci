and even so much as the apparel she was most fond of whilst she lived. lt ⁴

was exactly that day seven months after she died, when, as I was laying on
this bed, as '1 do nOW, and consoling mysels with reading Plato's treatise on
the soul, Dameneta herself came, and sat herself down by me, in the place
where Eucratides now is (pointing it out to his youngest son, who, as chil-
dren generally do, stood aghast, and grew pale at the narration); as soon as
I saW, continued he, Iembraced her, and crying out, burst into tears: she
stopped rny eries, but gently complained, that though I had done every
thing else to ssiew my respect for her, 1 had omitted to burn one of her gol·

ed me, and not finding it, we could not consume it with the other: as we
were talking together on this, a cursed ἦ· Melitan dog barked-from under γ

“ Can you, Tychiades, disbelieve things so manifest as these, and which
happen every day ?” “ No, by Jupiter, said Ι ; they deserve to be well beat

’ἢ Burncd, &c.] This cussom does honour to Greciaa senfihility‚ and conveyS, perhaps, at
the same time some reproach on our opposite conduc‘It. The ancients burned every thing that
belonged to those they loved, the moderas put them up to public auffion.

ἦ· Melitam dog-J Melita, an issand on the coast of illyrium, in the Adriatic, was famous for
dogs. See Pliny.

χ Goldstz'ppcm] The ancients, probably, for the custom is mentioned by many authors,
made the same use of the gold ssipper as modern school-masters do of the ferula. Lucian's ap.
plicatiou of it to the «story is obvious and happy.

ξ As thegani, &c.] On the Grecian stage the gods and goddesses were frequently called ‘in to
aid the poet in his distress, and to bring on, sometimes rather absurdly, the denouement of the
piene. On these occasions, the Atheniam, who spared no expence in their theatres, took care
roaccommodate their deities with proper vehicles, probably superb triumphal cars, in which

vthey descended with proper solemnity 2 though, concerning the form of these struentes, and in
