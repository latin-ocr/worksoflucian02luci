3541LL1TERATE BOOK-HUNTER.

along, to the utter disgrace, both of the owner of the arms, and the maker
of them?

And do not you think you must look full as ridiculous with a fine book in
your hand, bound in purple, with golden boffes, reading it in such a man-
ner as, by your barbarous pronunciation, utterly to spoil and disguise it,
whilst every scholar laughs at you, and only the flatterers who are with you
cornrnend, and even they turn to one another, and make garne of you be-
hind your back?

And here, 1 will tell you what happened once at the Pythian garnes: a
certain Tarentine, whose name was Evangelus, a man of no mean birth, had
set his heart on gaining a vidtory there: as he was not by nature formed
either for strength or swiftness. 116 soon perceived that a contest in the Pa-
laestra, was what his abilities were by no means equal to, but thought he
could excel in finging·and playing on the harp3 a belief which he had bech
persuaded into, by forne ‘45 rascally friends, wh0‚ wlicnever 116 but touched
the stringS, were rnost lavish in their encomiums on him. He made his ap·-
pearance at Delphos, therefore, in great splendour, with a crown of laurel,
all covered with gold, and emeralds sprouting from it, representing the ber-
ries‚ and almost as large3 his harp truly admirable, both forits richness and
beauty, was all of solid gold, adorned with gernS, and precious stones, with
the figures of Apollo, Orpheus, and the Muses wrought upon it: the spec-
tators gazed and wondered.

At length, when the day of trial came on, three candidates appeared, of
which, Evangelus (for so the lots had determined‚) was second to perform :
after Thespis the Theban, who had acquitted himself with some reputation,
116 entered the lists, covered with gold, emeralds, beryls, and otherjewels,
which set offthe beauty of his purple garment : this struck the whole assem-
bly with astonishment, and raised their expectations of his performance3
n hen l0, as soon as he began to play and sing, his first stroke was dissonant
and inharmonious, and he broke three chords at once, by his violent blows
on the harp, and then sung something so harsh and † unmuse-like, that the
speftators immediately fell a-laughing, and the judges resenting the man’s
ignorance and audacity, commanded him to be whipped out of the theatre.
