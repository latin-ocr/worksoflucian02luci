PHILOPATRIS. 555

C R 1 Τ Ι Α S.
Well remember'd, Triephon; but, pray, inform me, are the affairs of the
Scythians registered in this book ?
T R Ι Ε P H 0 N.
O yeS, all nations; if there happen to be any good men amongst the

Gentiles.
C R 1 Τ Ι Α 8.

There must be a great many scribes then in heaven to take down every

thing· TRIEPHON.

Softly, my good friend, let us have no refleffions on this propitious god :
if you hope for eternal life, listen to me as an humble catechumen: if this
god could spread out the heaven, fix the earth upon the waters, form the
stam, and create man, what wonder is it if he could also observe and mark
down all their actions Ξ you know well enough those of your servants in your
own family; cannot God, therefore, wit.) more ease, know all the affitions,
and penetrate into all the thoughts of men? as to θ(- your gods, they are but
a jest to, and ridicule of all rnen of sense and understanding.

C R I T I A S.

You talk most divinely, and reverse the story of Niobe: for from a sta-

tue I arn become a man.

T R I E P H O N.
By this god, therefore, I swear, I will do you no harm.

C R Ι T 1 A S.
If you really love, you will not deceive me, or

† — think one thing, and another tell;

But let me hear this wonderful conversation, which you were witness to, that
I also may grow pale with astonishment, and ¹be changed, as you are, int0
another creature. lwould not be destroyed, like Niobe, but, like another
Philomela, live to sing your wonderous tale.

T R I E P H O N.
By the son, who proceeds from the father, Ι mean not to deceive you.

⁰ Your gods] If the Philopatris had been written, as Gesner contends‚ by that Lucian, who
was the friend of Julian the Apostate, is it probable he would have talked thus ofa religion pro-
fessed by the emperor?
