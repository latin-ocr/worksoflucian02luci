OU have often aiked me, my young friend, how you may become an
orator, and acquire the most noble and respectable title of a sophi-st:
you have even gone so far as to say, you cannot properly enjoy lise till you
have gained such a proficiency in the art of speaking as to be irrefistible, one
whom none should dare to oppose‚ but all Greece unite to admire : you are
resolved, therefore, to pursue the meam, whatever they may be, that are con-
ducive to this end: nor shall Ι refuse my instrue‘tions to a youth, who, like
you, ambitious of excelling in the noblest accomplilhments, and ignorant
how to acquire them, solicits adxice anu direci—jon. Listen then to what Ι
am going to say ‚ and make not the least doubt but that in a very short time
you will know every thing that is requifite, and be able to praffise it, pro-
vided that you continue to observe what 1 shall teach you, reflee't serioussy
upon it, and carefully tread in that path, till you reach the goal. The game
you are in chase of is, indeed, by no means poor or contemptible, but such
as will require toil and vigilance, and in pursuit of which there is nothing ¹
which ought not to be borne; for how many, you must remark, who be-
fore were rnen of no esteem, have, by their ikill in oratory, become rich,
great, and noble!
· In the mean time, be not difimyed or terrified by the multiplieity of 1:1-

bours which you are to undergo; for Ι (hall not carry you such a rough zmil
