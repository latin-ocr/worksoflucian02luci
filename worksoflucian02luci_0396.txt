with superior eloquence, for that the contrary to this might often happenz
but let him speak for himself, and prove, if he can, that the worse and more
contemptible the place is, the better it would be for the orator. As to my-
self, you have heard what 1 said, and 1 need not repeat it; Ι shall be silent,
therefore, and give place to him for a while, let him come forth and give
you his opinion.

The mater, noble judges, who lately addreffed you, has expatiated large-
ly on the beauties of this house ; so far am 1 from condemning him, that Ι
only mean to speak of those things which he had omitted; and to ihew‚ that
the more agreeable he hath been, the more astonishing it is, and contrary to
what might have been expected. And first, as he has mentioned the orna-
ments which women make use of, their gold and jewels, permit me to make
the same comparison : 1 affert, that they not only never appear the handsorner

this, that the voice is buried in a large and sonorous building, which rever-
berates the found, beats it back on the speaker, or, rather, is entirely lost
and confounded, as the flute would be by the trumpet‚ if they were played
on at the same time; or the pilot's song by the waves of the sea. That
the speaker would be animated and inspired by the beauty of the house, as
my opponent maintained, is, in my opinion, false and absurd3 the dire&
contrary is true: for it would only alarm, and intimidate him, when he
came to confider what a disgrace it must be to him, if, in such a place, the

persons, but by supposing that the orator, on these omanem, to shew his dexterity, after argu.
