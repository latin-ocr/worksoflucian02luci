404 THE LOVE01= ouRCOUNTRY.

greater honours they receive, the more willing are they to return with them
to their native country. The young are naturally fond of, and when they
arrive at riper years, and have more sense and wisdorn, they become still
more attached to it : every old man wissies to finisti his life where it began,
to commend his body to the fostering earth frorn whence it carne, and [0
fiee-p in the sepulchre of his fathers ; such dread hath every man of being con-
demned to remain in a foreign land. How much a good citizen loves his
country, the natives, and they alone can convince us; for strangers are con-
fidered but as bastards who wandel· about, satisfied with the neceffaries or
conveniencies of life, wherever they can meet with them, indulging‚ like
brutes, in sensual gratificationS, without either love for their country, or know-
lege of it: whilst those who confidet it as their mother, love the place 0f
their nativity, be it ever so small, barren, or desolate3 and though they
cannot commend its fertility, still praise and value it as their country: when
they see others boasting their extensive plains, and fertile nieadows, yet will
they not forget their own. ἦ They despise the horse-breeding land, and
praise that alone which bred and nourished themselves. I-Ie who is fitu-
ated in the finest issand, where they lead the happiest lives, still wishes to re.
turn home: nor will he accept of proffer'd immortality, chufing rather to
’ be buried in his own country: the † snioke of his paternal roof is prefer-
able to every foreign fire.

So dear to every man is his country, that legissators at all times, and in
all places, have punissied the most atrocious crimes with banishment, as the
greatest evil which they could inflict on the offender: and generals, before a
battle, always animate their soldiers by exhorting thern to fight for their
country; that narne gives eourage to the most fearful: who, indeed, can
hear it and be a coward?

laudant suae nutriculam pueritiae. There is a quaint antithefis, we may observe here, both be—
tween the verb and the participle, and the two epithets, ἴππόῖροφες, or horse—breeding‚ is op-
posed to κεροτροφες. See Odyss‘ey, Δ. ιοὸ.
