things thus obscure and unintelligible, not merely to offer their opinions as
conjeetures, but boldly t'o urge and insist upon them : to do every thing but
swear‚ that the * sun is a mass of liquid fire, that the moon is inhabited‚
that the stars drink water, and that the sun draws up the moisture from the
sea, as with a well-rope, and distributes liis draught over the whole creation ?
How little they agree upon any one thing, and what a variety of tenets they
embrace, is but too evident; forfirst, with regard to the world, their opi·
nions are totally different; some affirm that it hath neither beginning nor end;
some, whom 1 cannot but admire‚ point out to us the manner ofits constru&ion,
and the makes of it, a supreme deity, whom they worship as creator of the
universe; but they have not told us whence he came, nor where he exists;

neither, before the formation of this world, can we have any idea of time or

born at Clazoinene, in the first year of the seventieth Olympiad. See Plutarch and Diogenes
Laert.

’ζ Many werkin] This was the opinion of Democritus, who held that there were infinite
worlds in infinite space, according to all circumstances, some of which are not only like to one

another, but every way so perfeffly and absolutely equal‚ that there is no difference betwixt
thern. See Plutarch and Tully‚ Qest. Acad.

§ Anathan] Empedocles, ongrigentnni, a Pythagoream he held that there are two prin-
cipal powers in nature, :nnity and discord‚ und that

Sometimes, by friendsstip, all are knit in one,
Sometimes, by discord‚ sever’d and undone.
