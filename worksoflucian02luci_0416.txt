of fancy, any thing unguarded should escape them, too rigidly to examine
into ir, well knowing that we say many things merely for the sake of har-
mony and cadence. Verse, I know not how, will sometimes deal in light
and trivial matrem and if you take away our liberty of ²* fietion, you de-

divine better in these matters: he can sorerem, as well as you, that is it

the fields are burned up, a famine must ensue : he can tell us that we should
not plough in the middle of the summer, or, if we do, that we'ihall sow ⁴
our seed to no purpose; that we are not to cut the corn when it is green, if
we expe& any grain from it. Without divination he can tell you, that you
