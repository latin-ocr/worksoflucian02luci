‚as the father of the father’s father, and every thing flowing srom them, are
a part of, and sprung from our country: the relation ascends even to the
gods themselves, who love and revere their country: the earth and scas,
every thing human, we know, and believe, is under their care and insl ee»
tion3 but they prefer that city which gave them birth, to every other. The
countries of the gods are, doubtless, the most venerable ; and those issands
rnost divine, in which are celebrated the birth-days of the deities, and the
vows and sacrifices offered there, are most acceptable to them. If the name
of country, therefore, is dear even to the gods, how much more so ssmuld it
be to men ?

In his own country every man first beheld the light of the sun, and though
that god shines equally on all, yet doth he seem to every one to belong to
that peculiar place where he has the first view of him : there too hc first be-
gan to lisp his native tongue ; there first learned to worship the gods; even if
a man was born in a place which he should be obliged to quit for another
where more knowlege might be acquired, yet is he not to despise it, but ac-
knowlege himself indebted to his own country for the improvement, as to
that he owed the knowlege that there was another city which he might re-
pair to. For what purpose, indeed, do men search after every kind of learn-
ing and knowlege, but that they may be servicable to their country, or ac·
quire riches; but that they may supply the wants of the community? Doubt-
less, with the greatest reason, those who reap considerable benefits should be
grateful for thern, if we return thanks to individuals for the favours which
we receive from them, much more should we repay what is due to our coun-
try. Ingratitude to parents, is punishable by the laws, and our country is
our common parent whom we should pay for our support, by obedience to
those laws which she hath framed for us. No man, 1 believe, was ever so
totally unmindful of his own country, as, though settled in another, not to
have a regard for it. Those who meet with adverse fortune, are perpetually
calling to mind the bleffings of their own country, and even those with whom
every thing prospers, how happy soever they may be in other respects, still
larnent that they are not at horne ; migration is a grief, as well as a reproach
to all: and we constantly see, that even those, who, ina foreign country
have been distinguished by rank and fortune, who have been celebrated for
their learning or their valour, all hasten back to their own; they wish to
shew their happiness to none so much as to'their fellow-citizens, and the
