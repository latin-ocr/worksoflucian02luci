382 APOPHRAS.

like, nohody is to find fault with you. Mercury make an end of thee and
thy words together! say I, for where, in the name of Fortune‚ couldest
thou pick them up? From the works of some † Ialemus, I suppose, in
some dirty corner, full of rust and spiders; or, perhaPS, from the tablets of
Philaenis, which you always have by you, and which may come very pro·
pcrly from such a mouth as your's. And, now 1 talk of that, what if your
tongue should call you to account, and thus reproach you for the injuries you
have done to it! ‘⁶ Ι took thee up (it might say), thou ungrateful wretch,
poor and miserable, without bread to eat, and taught thee to flourish upon the
stage, made thee a Ninus, aMetiochus, and, moreover, an Achilles also;
did 1 not afterwards nourish and support thee as a syllable-nsonger, to teach
school-boys ? have not 1 lately enabled thee to repeat other people's speeches,
and become a sophist, acquiring honour and reputation which thou hadst no
right to? and dost thou now, after all, reward me thus, by employing me in
the meanest offices, in low and filthy conversation? Was it not enough to
make me every day tell lies for thee, vent false oaths, talk nonsense, and re-
peat so many ridiculous speeches? and now thou wilt not suffer mc tolie quiet
even of nights‚ but force me to play the fool: forgetting I arn a tongue‚
and making use ofme as a hand, to do all thy dirty work for thee, treat me
after all, like a stranger, and put a thousand affronts upon me. My bufi.
ness is only to talk, and not to perform offices which other members were de-
signed for by nature: would to heaven I were cut out, as Philomela’s was !
sor happier are even the tongues of those who have devoured their own
children than 1 am.''

Now, by the gods, if that same tongue of thine should speak for itself,
and, calling in thy beard to its aid, should thus address thee, what answer
couldest thou make? The same, Isuppose, as you did to Glaucas, when
he reproached you for a certain crime, that by this means you would soon
become conspicuous, and universally admired. You are, indeed, conspicu-
ous enough, and to be talked of, be it in any manner whatsoever, is, no
doubt, at least in your opinion, most defireable. You might then tell him
all the names you have gone by in your travels3 1 marvel much, whilst you

are not offended at them, you should be so angry with the appellation of
poor Apophras.

the word ιαλεμος, turned into an adjective, according to Hesychius, signifies stupid, dun, un„
