405 DIPSADES.

others half buried in the sand; toads, asps‚ vipers, ‘¹' ramstiorns, datter-s,
ul« cantharides, amphisbenae, and dragous ; two species of scorpions, one very
large, with feet, that wall< on the ground, with a number of vertebrae in
the tail, the other flying in the air, with a membranous kind of wing like
bats or grasshoppers; this kind of birds renders that part ofLibya which they

frequent almost impassable.
But of all the noisomc creatures impregnated by the hot sands the most

dreadsul is the DipsaS, a small serpent like the viper, which bites with the
greatest violence, and leaves a thick poison, which no medicine can extir-
pate; it brings on immediate putrefaftion, and burns in such a manner that
the person bit eries out as if hc was in a fite : but its most terrible effe& is
that sensation from whence the creature takes its ξς name; the man grows
thirsty beyond all conception, and, which is most astonissring, the more he
drinks, becomes the more desimus of liquor, nor would the whole Nile or
Danube, if he could swallow them, quench his thirst: the water, like pour-
ing oil on fire, only increases the disorder. The sons of physic account for
this by saying‚ that the thick poison being diluted by the liquor, becomes
liquid, moves with greater velocity, and spreads itself more widely over the
body. 1 have never seen myself‚ nor Ι hope ever shall, any one under this
dreadful calamity, as I never, thank heaven, ventured to set foot in Libya,
but 1 have heard of an inscription, which a friend of mine told me he had-
read, on the tomb of a man who perissied in this manner : he rnet with it in
his way to Egypt, on a journey to the Greater Syrtis, on the sea shore,
where a pillar was ereeted, with figures alluding to the manner of his death.
Engraved on it was a man standing, as they represent Tantalus on the
shore, endeavouring to drink3 a dipsas wreathed round his leg, and near
him several women bringing water and pouring it upon him: not far off
were a number of eggs, supposed to be left by the ostriches, which, asI
before mentioned, the Garamantes are so fond of hunting: beneath was
the following inscription,

Thus Tantalus, of old, cou'd ne’er affuage
Of dreadful thirst th' unconquerable rage;
