JUPITERCONFUTED. 151

C Y N 1 S C U S.
Spare your threats, good Jupiter, for you very well know, nothing can
happen to me but what the Parcae have predestined: even sacrilege, I see,
is not punished; it is not, 1 suppose, in the Fates, that it should be.

J U P 1 T E R.
Did not Ι say before, you were one of those who deny a providence?
C Y N I S C U S.
These are the men you seem to be most afraid of, and whatever Ι say, you
attribute to them3 but Ι appeal ‘to yourself, and beg leave to asst you what
that providence is which you talk of ς is it one of the Parcae, or a greater

goddess who gives laws to them?

U P 1 T E R.
Ι told you, before you mgst not be too inquifitive, and want to know every

thing. At first you only defired to ask one question, and now you teize me
with a thousand: I see your defign, plainly enough, to prove, that we
take no care of human affairs.
C Y N Ι S C U S.
Ι have no such intention, but you said a little while ago, that the Fatess
did every thing; now, perhaps, you mean to recant.
J U Ρ Ι Τ Ε R.
By no means : Fate does every thing, but then it is through us.
C Y N 1 S C U S.
You are only the servants then, the ministers of the Fates; and the provi-
dence, after all, is theirs‚ whilst you are nothing but mere iustruments.

J U P 1 T Ε R.
What do you mean ?

C Y N I S C U S.
That as axes and hammers are useful to a smith in his art, though nobody

calls thern artist53 and a ship is not the work of the axe or hammer, but of
the builder : in like manner, Fate is the architeet of our great ship,
and you are but their axes and hammers ; and yet men, it seemS, instead of
sacrificing to the Fames, and arking bleffings of thern, come to worship you
for thern: nor, if they were to pay their adorations there, would they be
much the better for it, for the Fates themselves cannot alter their own dc-
cree; not would Atropos or Clotho ever suffer their spindles to be turned

backward, and their work unravellcd,
