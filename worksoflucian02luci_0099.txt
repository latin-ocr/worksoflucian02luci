DEFENCEOF THEPORTRAIT. 93

and keeps within proper limits. These, out of many that might be men-
tioned, are the specific differences of praise and adulation, which I must beg
you to remark, that you may not suspeft all of flattery, but distinguish be-
tween them, and give to each its proper measure.

Let me then be judged by this rule3 apply it to what I have written con-
cerning you, and say to which class I belong. Had I compared an ugly and
deformed wretch to the Cnidian Venus, I had been, indeed, an impostor,
a worse flatterer than Cinaethus, but when Ispoke of one who, as every body
kneW, deserved all that could be said of her, surely it could not be censured
as deviating from the truth.

⁵ But, perhaps, you will say (you have, indeed, already said), that Ι might
have praised your beauty, but that I ought not thus invidioussy to compare
a mortal to a goddess: but, for 1 must tell you the real truth, 1 did not
compare a mortal to a goddess, but only to the work of an eminent artist in
brass, stone, or ivory. There could be no impiety in saying that resembled
a mortal which was made by on·e; unless you will say the piffi‘ture by Phi·
dias was the true Minerva, or the statue made at Cnidus but a few years
fince, by Praxiteles, was the celestial Venus: take heed, noble lady, you
think not thus of the immortals, whose true image is far beyond the reach
of human imitation.

But if l had even said, you were like the goddesses themselves, I am not
the first who struck out this path 3 many of our best poets have done it be-
fore me, and particularly Homer, your own fellow—citizen, whom Ι here
call upon to plead for me, for he must fall under the same condemnat-ion :
let me ask him, or rather let me ask you for him (sor you remember, and
happily for you, all his charming verses), does he not tell υς, when speaking

, of the captive Briseis, that she, who resembled golden Venus, wept over

Patroclus, and a little after, as if not satisfieri with comparing her to Venus
only, he says,

ἧς Prone on the body felI-the HEAVENLY fair.
And do you abhor him for this, do you throw by his book, or do you ai]-

low him the liberty of praise? if you refusc, posterity hath already bestowed
it on him3 I know none who accuse him of impiety, nor is there a man to be

ἃ Prone, &eff See Homer’s Iliad, book xix, Pope here calls her the κεΛνεΝιΥ sair,
which is a bad transsation of Homer's Εικηοι Θιησι.
