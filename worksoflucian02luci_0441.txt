account, they collected money for 111111, and he made a very pretty rcvumc
of it. These * poor men, it seems, had persuaded themselves that the)-
ihould be immortal‚ and live for ever. They despiscd death, there-sore,
and offered up their lives a voluntary sacrifice, being taught by their law-
giver, that they were all brethren, and that quitting our Grecian gods, they
must worship their own sophist who was crucified, and live in obedience to
his laws. In compliance with thern, they looked with contempt on all
worldly treasures, and Ἃ1116111 every thing in common, a maxim which they
had adopted >without any reason or foundation. If any cunning impostor,
therefore, who knew how to manage matters, carne amongst 1116111, 116 soon
grew rich by impofing on the credulity of these weak and foolish 111611.
Pelegrinus, however, was set at liberty by the governor of Syria, a man
of learning, and a lover of philosophy, who, withal, well knew the folly of
the man, and that he would willingly have suffered death sor the sake of that
glory and reputation which he would have acquired by it; thinking hini,
however, not worthy offo honourable an exit, he let him ιρρ. On his return
horne, he found the report of his having killed his father had gained ground
amongst the people, and that many had threatened to prosecute him for ir.
Most of his money was already expended in his travels, and he had only
about fifteen talents left3 for the whole which the old rnan died worth, did
not amount to more than thirty, though that ridiculous fellow Theagenes
told you it was five thousand. The whole city of Parium, with the five next
to it, if they were to be sold, with their cattle, rnen, and every thing be-
longing to thern, would not fetch so much.
The affair of the murther was now spread abroad, and somebody‚ it was
¹generally thought, would soon stand forth, and accuse him. The populace
were enraged, and lamented the loss of the good old man, taken away in so

ssiameless a manner. But, observe how the cunning Proteus contrived to

ι· ‘77³‘st poor men, Εὔα] One cannot help observing, that Lucian is here endeavouring to turn
the primitive Christians into ridicule, for those very customs and manners, which, in the eyes
of every sober and thinking man, must render 1116111 most respec‘table. He laugha at thern for
supporting their‘friends‚ and vifiting them in prison, for their hopes ofimmortality, for their
contempt of richen, and for dividing the little they had amongst the poor and neceffitous.

ἢ· Held every thing in commum] This custorn of the early Christians, though founded on the
noblest principles of benevolence, was attended with some bad consequences, as it gave the
means of subfistence to many idle and dissolute beggam, probably very unworthy objeets ot
charity‚ to whom, notwithstanding, they could not deny the common right claimed by convert·

by it.
