94 DEFENCEoF THE PORTRAIT.

found who will dare to beat his statue, or to mark these verses as ἦ· spurious,
and not belonging to him. Shall Homer then, liken a weeping Barbarian to
golden VenuS, and I, because you will not be praised for beauty, must not
compare even to the statue of) goddess the most lovely of women, whose
chearful countenance is ever covered with smiles? fo'r in smiles, at least, we
resemble the immortals. Observe, in his Agamemnon, how sparing he is
of his divinities, giving him a proportior] of each, his eyes and head arelike
Jove, his belt like Mars, and his breast like Neptune3 dividing the man in-
to parts, to suit his representation ofthe deities : in another place he com-
pares him to Mars, the man-ssayer. Phryges, he tells us, had the form of a
g0d3 and often calls Achilles the godlike son of Peleus. But Ι must return
to examples of women ; you remember where he says,

Like Dian she, or golden Venus

 

And again,
As Dian wand'ring o’er the mountains strays.

He not only likens men themselves to gods, but even talks of Euphorbus’s
hair, and that stained with blood, as resembling the Graces. There is not,
in short, any species of poetry that is not adorned with divine images ε blot
them all out, therefore, or indulge me in the same liberty. So far, indeed,
are fimilitudes of this kind from being liable to censure, that Homer fre-
quently praises his deities by images drawn from inferior nature: compares
Juno’s eyes to those of an ort, another poet tells us, Venus had eye-brows
like violets, and who, that knows ever so little of the blind bard, does not
remembei· his rosy-finger'd goddess?

To be likened to the gods in shape and form is surely venial ε how much
holder are those who affume their names, like DionyfiUS, Haephestion, Zeno,
Posidonius, and I-Iermaeus! The wife of EvagoraS, king of CypruS, called ⁷
herself Latona3 and yet the goddess resented it not, though ss1e might have
turned her, like Niobe, into stone. I need not mention the AEgyptians,
who, though the most superstitious of all people‚ make use of the divine
names perpetually: every thing with thern comes from heaven.

Yon need not, therefore, be so fem-ful of praise3 if there be any thing
impious or profane in'whatI wrote, it is not your fault, unless you think it
