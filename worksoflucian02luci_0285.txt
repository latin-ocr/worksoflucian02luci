q You know little at present, Itell you, of our manners3 by and by you
will think better of thern: when you corne to the alsembly, and sec such
numbers of people gathered together, and the amphitheatre filled with so
many thousand spectators, the combatants crowned with shouts of applause,
and the conqueror equalled‘sr: fignour and glory to the gods.
ANACHARSIS.

That, nour, to rne appears the most unfortunate circumstance of all3 to
suffer so many hardssrips, not before a fewjudges only, but in the fight of
so rnany· people, who are eye-witnesses of their misery, and compliment
them so highly when they are bleeding at every vein, and half-choaked by
their adversaries; for this it seems is the happiness of victory. Now,
amongst us Scythiam, if any one beats a citizen, throws him down, or
tears his cloaths off his back, he is severely punissied by our elders, even
when there are ever so few witnesses, and not in large and spacious theam-es,
such as you tall< of at your Isthmians and Olympics. Ι pity the combatants
most smeerely on account of their sufferingS, and asto your speetators, com-
posed, as you say, of the first people in the state, who frequent these assern-
blies, Iwonder not a little how they can neglect their own affairs to throw
away their time on such things as these, nor do Ι understand what pleasure
they can find in seeing rnen beating‚ squeezing, and tear-ing one another.

If this was the season of our public gmnes, you would then see hoxv ustful
and agreeable they are3 you cannot by description form any idea of the plea-
sure which it would give you to fit amidst a number of spectator& and ob-
serve the courage ofthe rnen, the beauty of their forins, their strength and
agi'lity, their skill and bravery‚ their unconquerable spirit, and never-eeafing
defu-e of fame and ᾔθεοι-Ἠ Iam sure, if you were to be an eye-witness of
it, there would be no end of your acclamations and applause.

ANAciflARSIS.

Rather say, my friend, of ridicule and censure3 for to tell you the trurh,
I think all those mighty virtues, you talk of, that strength, skin, and spirit,
is only thrown away for nothing, when neither your country is in (larges,
your lands laid waste, nor your friends injured nor affronted3 if the comba-
tants, therefore, are, as you say, persons of the first rank, more fools aare

they, to suffer so much for nothing, to contenti with misfortune‚ and mn
