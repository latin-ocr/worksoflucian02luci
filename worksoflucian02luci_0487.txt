1f1 know any thing of Lycinus, hc will do that better himself: take
care to tell every body, and save me the trouble: but pray rell mc, did
Aristaenetus invite you to celebrate the marriage of his son Zeno?

L Y C I N U S.
Νο; it was the wedding of his daughter Cleanthis, whom he has just

married to the son of Eucritus, the money-lender, a great admirer of phi-

losophy. P H 1 L o.

. A very handsome b0y; but, 1 should think, rather too young for a wife.

· L Y C I N U S.

Isuppose he could not pick outa more proper husband, accomplished,
as he is, with a strong bent to philosophy; and, moreover, the only son of
Eucritus, who is extremely rich : he was, surely, the very man Aristaenetus

could have wished for.
P H 1 L Ο.

Such a fortune, indeed, was a good reason; but who were your guests?

L Y C I N U S.
Of philosophers, for as to the rest yon have no curiosity, there were, the

old Stoic Zenothemis, and Diphilus, surnamed the ³¹⁶ Labyrinth, Zeno's
master : of the Peripatetics, Cleodemus, who, you know, is famous for the
force and subtilty of his arguments; his scholars call him the Sword and
Scythe. There was, likewise, Hermon, the Epicurean, whom the Stoics
looked upon with an evil eye; no better, you may suppose, than a parri-
cide and a murtherer. These were invited, as being Aristaenetus’s most
intimate friends3 and with them came Histiaeus, the grammarian, and Dio-
nysodorus, the rhetorician. The bridegroom, Chaerea, introduced also Ion,
the Platonic, who was his master, whose person and appearance were truly
respeetable 3 uprightness and integrity ssione forth in his countenance‚ where-
fore he was generally styled the Model, in allusion to the rediitude of his
conduc‘t ε on his entrance, every body rose up, and paid him reverence, as
to a superior being3 there was, indeed, in his air and manner, something
truly god-like and divine.
