ICARo-MENIPPUS. 2¹7

FRIEND.

Let me have an exa& account of all your travels, 1 beseech yon, omit
not the least particular, but give me your observations upon every thing; 1
expe& to hear a great deal about the form and figure of the carth, and hou:
it all appeared to you from such an eminence.

M E N 1 P P U S.

And so you ss1a113 ascend, therefore, in imagination with me to the moon,
and confidet the situation and appearance of the earth from thence ε suppose
it to seem, as it did to me, much less than the moon, insomneh, that when
I first looked down, I could not find the high mount-ains, and the great sea;
and, if it had not been for the .÷- Rhodian Coloffus, and the tower of Pharos,
should not have known where the earth stood. At length, however, by the
reflection of the sun-beams‚ the ocean appeared, and shewed me the land, ”
when, keeping my eyes fixed upon it, 1 beheld clearly and distinffly every
thing that was doing upon earth, not only whole nations and eines, but all
the inhabitants of them, whether waging war, cultivating their fields‚ trying
causes, or any thing else; their women, animals, every thing, in short, was

before me.
F R l E N D.

Most improbable, all this, and contradidory3 you told me-but just be-
fore, that the earth was so little by its great distance, that you could scarce
find it, and, if it had not been for the Coloffus‚ would not have appeared
at all; and nOW‚ on a sudden, like another Lynceus, you can spy out men,
trees, animals, nay, [suppose, evena fleas nest, if you chose it.

MENIPPUS.

Ithank you for putting me in mind os what 1 had forgot to mention.
XNhen 1 beheld the earth, but could not distinguish the obje&s upon it, on

account of the immense distance, 1 was horribly vexed at it, and ready to
cry, when, on a sudden, vl* Empedocles the philosopher stood behind me,

all over ashes, as black as a coal, and dreadsnlly scorched : when 1 saw him,

Ἃ· Rhodiam Coloffics ] See note on this in a former dialogue.
† Empedoclcn] lt is reported os Empedocles, that he went to AEma, where he leaped into tlte
sire, that he might leave behind 111111 an opinion that he was a god, and that it was asterwaids

discovered by one ot' his sandals, which the fise cast up again, for his sandals were of brass. hee

ent authors. This wne, however, the generally received sable. Luciam, with an equid degree
ofprobability, carries him up to the moon.
