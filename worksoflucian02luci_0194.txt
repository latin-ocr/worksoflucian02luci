Homer, where *ff* Xanthus, Achilles' horse. takes his leave of neighing,
and, in the middle of the battle, talks away, not like me, in humble prose,
but repeats whole verses, turns prophet, and foretells what is to come to
pass, and no body wonders at it, calls upon heaven to avert the omen, or
thinks there is any thing dreadful in it: what would you have said if you
had heard the ξ’, ship of the Argonauts talk, or the oak of Dodona prophe-
cying, or the half-roasted §oxen creeping about, and lowing upon the spit?

< ᾗ llbmz'cr-working.] Greek, τερασιε. The ancients gave their gods different epithets‚ in con-
sequence οἱ the different funffions affigned to them: thus Jupiter was called ξενιος, the hospi„
table, φλιος, the friendly, σκηπ-τεχος, the scepter-bearer, διε. Lucian here gives him the new
name ot'oespxcmg, prodigialis, or the wonder-worker; alluding to the extraordinaty prodigy of
a speaking cock.

ἦ· Xanthus] Alluding to that passage in the latter end of the nineteenth book of the Iliad,
where Achilles addresses his ponies,

Xanthus and Balius of Podarges’ strain.

The former answers him, and foretells his death. Homer tells uS, that Juno endowed him
with the faculty ofspeech on this occafion, and the Furies tookitaway again immediately. Lu-
ciam, who nex-er unffi-:s an opportunity of ridiculing Homer-’s speciosa miracula, seizes on this
to laugh ar him for the improbability of this event. See Pope’s Homer's Iliad, book xix. 1. 446.

ζ Ship] The famous strip, that carried Jason to Colchos in search of the golden fleece‚ was
said to have been made our ot* the oaks of Dodona, sacred to Jupiter, from which were deliver-
ed so many fine oracles: that these oaks were maculat, no orthodox heathen ever doubted; for
the lliip's speaking. we have no authority but Lucian’s.

ξ Omm] Alluding to that paffage in the Odyffey‚ where the companions of Ulyffes ssew the
oxtn os the sun, and most strange prodigies ensued, for
