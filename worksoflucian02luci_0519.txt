ENCOMIUM ON DEMOSTHENES. 5¹3

right of Ptolengy’s temple, that, I mecm, wilh the long haim] I must request hinx
to inspire me with some good lines.
L Y C I N U S.
If prayers would do on these occafions‚ I should ask the same favour my-
self of Demosthenes, and beg him to give me something on his birth-day·
also, and, thus, we might both be the better for it.

THERSAGORAS.

For my daily and nightly labours, and for the fine and happy flow of my
verses, 1 ought certainly to thank Homer3 for I have been, as it were, di*
vinely inspired, and with a kind of Bacchanalian fury in every thing 1 have
written3 but you shalljudge yourself; for I have brought my little book here
along with me, that, ifI lit on an idle friend, Ι might shew it to him3 and
luckily you seem to be quite at leisure.

L Y C 1 N U S.

Yon are a happy fellow, indeed, and just like a conqueror in the tace,
who, after wiping off his own dust, entertains himself with laughing at a
poor man who is going to enter the lists, andis frightened out of his wits at

thedanger.
THERSAGORAS.

You talk as if there was any thing so very difficult in the tassz.

L Y C 1 Ν U S.
Yon think, perhaps, Demosthenes is not to be compared to Homer as εἰ·

x subjecit for panegyric, and that Ι, therefore, have but little to do.

THERSAGORAS.
You wrong me: Inever meant to make a difference between the two

heroes, though Ι may prefer one to the other.

, L Y C 1 N U S.
i And why should not Ι do the same? You do not despise my subje& then3
but, perhaps, poetry‚ you think, is the only thing of consequence, and
hold oratory in no esteem3 as horsemen look down with contempt on foot

soldier& ⁴
THERSAGORAS.

No, far be it from rne3 though the poet must, no doubt, have a kind of

divine fnry about him.
L Y C Ι N U S.

The prose writer too, let me tell you, must have some inspiration, if he
would soar above the vulgar.
