sacrifices then, you say, are only intended to {hew gratitude and respee‘t3
but if one of our sophists were here, he would ask you, perhaps, in what
the superiority of the Gods confists, when they are only fellow-servants with
men, and subjee’t to the same mistrdsts, the Fates; your immortality does
not make you better, but rather so much the worse3 for death, if nothing
else, will set them free3 but your ssavery must continue as long as they please
to extend the thread, and lasts for ever.

But then, Cyniscus‚ our happiness is infinite andpeternal.

Not to all of you, some have trouble enough ; you, indeed, may be happy,
who are the king, and can let ,down your ’ἃ rope, and draw the earth and
seas after y0u; but what think you of lame Vulcan, a poor sooty labourer3
Prometheus too, who was chained to a rock3 not to mention your own vf- fa.
ther, who was bound in Tartarus. They tell us too, that some of you fall
in love, others are wounded, others become the ssaves of mortals‚ as your
:11 brother was to Laomedon, and Apollo to Admetus. There seems to be
no great happiness in all this 3 some of you, perhaps, may be fortunate, and
others just the contrary. Not to mention that you often get among thieves
who rob and plunder you, and you fall frorn affluence into penury3 if you
happen to be ῃ gold or filver, they melt you down, even just as the Fates

have decreed.

ξ Βνωῐιεν.] Neptune, we are told, was banifhed from heaven for conspiring against Jupiter,
who sent him down to earth, and obliged him to go into the service of Laomedon, the father ef
Priam, and king of Troy, who employed himin making dikes to prevent inundations: which, it
seems, being sseilled, as Neptune must have been, in all maritime affairs, he performed to
a miracle-

ῃ Gold.] The gold and filver statues of the Pagan divinities were frequently, we may stsp-
pose, melted down by the poffeffors of them, when occasion required, just as our modern ma,
