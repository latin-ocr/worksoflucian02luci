THEPORTRAIT. 81

To the business then. And first, She is eloquent, and witty: with much
more reason might Homer have said of her than of the Pylian fage,

'W Words, sweet as honey, from his lips distill'd.

The tone of her voice is inexpreffibly soft and harmonious, not strong or
masculine, nor thick and broken ; but like that of youths just before the age
of manhood, sweet and pleasant, stealing gently on the ear, so that even when
it: ceases, the words still dwell upon the sense, like echo lengthens out the
sound, and leaves a pleafing remembrance on the mind, full of grace and pcr-
suafi0n3 when she fings or playS, swam, gralhoppers, and halcyons‚ must be
filent; for, compared with her, they are rough and inharmonious; and
the ψ daughter of Pandion, with all her power of voice,woul‹l appear ignorant
and unmufical. Orpheus and Amphion, who so charmed their audience
that even things inanimate were attracted by their songs, if they heard her,
would leave their lyres, and listen in silent attention to her. So well does ihc
know how to preserve true harmony, so to aecompany her instrument, as⁴
never to be out· of time or tune, to swell and fink in such a manner, as
that the voice and lyre shall set off each other, with that easy 'touch of the
finger, and motion of the limbs, which so distinguissied the great ξς mufician
of Thrace, and Η him who touched the lyre as he fed his cattle on Cithaeron.
‚ Trust me, Lycinus, if ever you hear her fing, you will not, like those who
beheld the Gorgon, be turned into stone3 but will experience the fate of
them who were allured by the Syrens3 you will stand amazed and confound-
ed, regardless of your country, your,family, and your friends. Stop up
your ears ever so close, her voice will penetrate through all3 for such is the
song of Terpsichore, of Melpomene, and Calliope, with a thousand en-
chantments of every kind to adorn and recommend it. Think, in a word,
what the harmony rnust belwhich paffes through such teeth, aud is urtered
by such lips as her’s, You have seen part of what Ι tell you, imagine to
yourself that you hear the rest.

That lhe should speak correffly and in pure Ionic‚ that her conversation is
full of wit and Attic grace, is by no means to be wondcred at: {he had it
