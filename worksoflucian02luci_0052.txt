46 OnDANCING.

other time, an immotlcrately tall fellow, dancing in the charaeter of Capa-
neus, who wasto scale the Theban wall, “ get up, they cried, you do not want
a ladder :'' a fat heavy ἀεικεῖ, attempting to make a great leap, they roared
out, “ take care you do not beat the stage down ;'’ and a poor mcagre creature
cutting capers, they cried out, “ I with you better,'' as if the man had been
sick. Imention these remarks, not for the jest's sake, but that you may
perceive that there are whole nations, who consider the art of so much con-
sequence as to prescribe what is becoming in it, and whatis not so.

The bodyof the good dancer must, rnoreover, be both flexible and com-
patet, that it may bend easily, or stand firm, as occasion shall require. Dane-
ing, with regard to the motion of the hands, partaking in agreat measure
the nature of boxing in the public ganimi, and borrowing ti'hatever is beau-
tiful and becoming from the rites of Hercules, Mercury, and PolluX. He-
rodotus tells us, that the ἦ* eye conveys more faithful intelligence than the

cup os oblivion, as the ᾗ· poet says,

 

Of soveregn use t'affuage

The boiling bosom of tumultuous rage,
To clear the cloudy front of wrinkled‘care,
And dry the fearful ssuices of despair.

It is a certain sign that there is in this art something analogous to our na-
ture, if the speitator weeps when any thing sad and mournful is represented.
The Bacchanalian (lance, which is so constantly performed in Ionia and Pon-
tus, though a satirica} one, has such an effe& on the people there, that at
cer-min seasons they neglect every thing else, to fit whole days viewing
the Titans, Corybantes, Satyrs, and {hepherdsz even the nobility and
chief persons there join in the dance, and are so far from being affiamed‚
that they are more proud of it than of their high birth, honours, and dig-
niues.
