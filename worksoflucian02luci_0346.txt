GALLIC HERCULES.

‘I his ftems to be a kind of Prooemium or Preface to mee Declamation, which Lucum,
as a Rhetorician had been appointed to deli-ver, on what Subjett we know not;
the Idea flag-g‘tstea' to him by the Pinare of a Gallie Hercules, was well adapted
to his Purpose, though there is not any Wt or Humour in the Compofilion‚ nor
