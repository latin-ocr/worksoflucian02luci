THE EUNUCH. 53

a little before our time, But Diocles, even admittiiig that there was such a
one, and-that he had been suffered to do this, would not allow the force of
the argument, nor pay any regard to the glory he had acquired from an ig-
norant multitude : he mentioned at the same time, several severejokes thrown
out particularly by the Stoics and Cynics, upon his bodily imperfection. The
whole matter, therefore, with the judges, rested on this, whether an eunuch
was qualified to teach philosophy, and to prefide over youth ? some affert-
ing, that a philosopher should have every part of his body whole and corn-
plete, and above all, a long beard, that might procure him respect and au-
thority amongst his disciples‚ and render him in every respect worthy
the drachmas allowed by the emperor, that an eunuch was worse than one who
had been totally emasculated‚ sor they had enjoyed their virility for some
time, as the former were deprived of it even from their infancy, and could
be considered only as an ambiguous creature like the εῑοννε, which are rec-
koned neither amongst the pigeons nor the ravens.

. On the other hand, it was strongly urged, that this was properly a conten-
tion of minds‚ and not bodies; it was a matter of science and learning, and
Aristotle was cited, who admired Hermius the eunuch, king of Aternae, to
such a degree, that he even paid divine honours to him as to a god. Ba-
goas had the impudence to add, that eunuchs were the best preceptors sor
young men, as they must be free from all suspicion, and could not be ac-
cused of the crime attributed to Socrates, of corrupting the pupils commit·
ted to his care. And when they objected to him his want of beard, he re-
plied wittily, at least as he thought it, “ lf we must judge of philosophers by
the length ostheir beard, a ''r'‘ goat must lte preferable to them all.''

In the midst of this buslle came in a third person, whose name shall not
be mentioned3 who cried out, ‘⁶ Judges, this ἦ fellow with the smooth
chin, and woman’s voice, who is so like a eunuch, if you strip him, will be
found as good a man as you could wilh for3 at least, if those say true who
have accused him as an adulterer, and taken him in the fact, when he had
recourse to this artifice, and pretended to be an eunuch; persuading the
judges, from his outward appearance, to acquir him of the crime laid to his

{- Thisftlloztv] It is remarkable, that this circumstance should, so many years after, form the
ground-work of an English cotnedy. Wycherley’s Country Wife turns entirely upon it, and
the charaeter of Horner is but a transcript of Lucian's Bagoas. Such a plot, to our honour be

it spoken, would not go down in the present age.
