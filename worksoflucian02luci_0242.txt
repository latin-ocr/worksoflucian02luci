“ Oyez, oye2‚ all people, take notice, that on this day, and good
luel< attend it! being the sevemh of February, there is to be a hearing3
whoever has any causes to try, let him appear in the Areopagus3 where
Justice will herself attend and preside3 will appoint judges from amongst the
whole Athenian people; every judge to have three oboli, and the ἦ number
of the judges to be in proportion to the crime: those who, having began
their process, died before it was determined, † AEacus has orders to send
back ; and if any one shall think himself wronged by the sentence here pro-

nounced, he may appeal to Jupiter.''

P A N.

What a noise and clamour there is amongst them ! how they croud to-
gether, and drag one another up the hill! but here comes Mercury. You
may go and do your justice business, if you please‚ as in duty bound; as
sor ine, Ι shall beg leave to retire to my cave, play upon rny pipe, and sing
a love-song, as I usually do, to provoke Echo: of judicial determinations
Ι have enough already, for 1 hear thern every day.

M E R C U R Y.
Come, Justice, shall we call them over ?

J U S T 1 e E.
By all means, for they stand very thick, and are buzzing about, you see,

like so many wasps.

I have you now, rascal.

You will pay for it at last.

Ι shall prove you guilty of such faets —

ἃ Numbem] In some of the Grecian courts of judicature, the number of the judges, who
were chosen by lot, was in proportion to the weight of the cause to be decided 3 sometimes there
were fifty, and sometimes two or five hundred. When causes of great consequence were to be
tried, it was customary to call in all the judges of other courts; and sometimes, we are told,
they· amounted even to fifteen hundred, or two thousand.

† AEacusq One ofthe three judges in hell, appointed with his two affiffors, Minos and
Rhadamanthus, to try rnen after death, and 1ο punish or reward thern as they deserved.
