us. 1 beg, Jupiter, Ι may be quite at liberty to say what 1 please. Every
body knows how free Ι am with my tongue, and that 1 never conceal what
is bad·‚ but boldly find fault with every thing that is wrong, and speak
plain, nor arn ever afraid or ashamed to deliver my opini0n3 insomuch‚ that
1 have been called testy and troublesome, nay, accused by many as a calum-
niator, and public informer: but fince proclamation is now made, andI
have your perrniffion withal‚ 1 am resolved to speak without fear or restraint.
I do say, therefore, that there arc many here, wh0‚ not satisfied with fitting
along with us, and eating at our table, have brought their servants and fol-
lowers into heaven, and deified them also : these have sat down with υς, and
partook of our sacrifices, without paying the tax due to us from them, as

strangers and sojourners.

Momus, let us have nothing dark, or aenigmatical‚ but speak plainly
and openly, and name what names you please; for the affair is now before
the public, and every one is to give his opinion fairly and candidly : a free
speaker must have no shuffling or evafion.

Most excellent Jupiter, to exhort me to freedom of speech! This is most
king-like, great, and magnificent indeed3 then will 1 tell his name. The
noble Bacchus, that halfmortal, not so much as sprung from a Grecian, by
the mother-'s fide3 but the grandson of Cadmus, a Syro-Phoenician mer-
chant : as he is dignified with immortality‚ I shall not say what he is hirn-
self‚ nor take notice of his fillet, his hobbling gait‚ or his drunkenness;
you all know how weak and effeminate he is, generally half-mad, and srnell-
ing of wine pretty early in the morning: here has he brought in his whole
tribe upon us, and made gods of Pan, Silenus, and the Satyrs, rustics, goat-
, herds, wild dancers, and ereatures with strange forms ·. one of thern has got
’ἑὲ horns, and a long beard, and, from the waist downwards, is exactly like
a goat: another, a little †bald-pated old man, with a flat nofe, a Lydian ix
seems, and generally rides upon an ass : then there are the Satyrs, with their
ears cocked up, bald, and with horus, like young kids; these are Phrygi-
ans, and allos them, befides their other perfectioris, have long tails. You
see what kind of gods he has generoussy provided us with. And can we
wonder that mortals should laugh at us, when they behold such a set of
