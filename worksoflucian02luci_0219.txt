1CARO-MEN1PPUS. 213

pierces through every thing, the impetuous thunder, the κ rain, hail, and
snOW, all raised my admiration, and seemed inexplicable to human reason.
In this fituation of mind, the best thing l thought which I could poffibly do,
was to consult the philosophers3 they, Imade no doubt, were acquainted
with the truth‚ and could impart it to me: stleffing, therefore, the best of
them, as well as Ι could judge from the paleness and severity oftheir coun-
tenances, and the length of their beards (for- they seened all to be high-
speaking and heavenly-rninded men); into the hands of these I entirely re-
figned myself, and partly by ready money, partly by the promise of inore,
whenthey had made me completely wise, 1 engaged them to teach me the

You will laugh, my friend, when Ι (hall tell you of their pride and im-
pudence in the relation of extraordinary events; to think that men, who
creep upon this earth, and are not a whit wiser, or can see further than our-
selves, some of them old, blind, and lazy, should pretend to know the li-
mits and extent of heaven, measure the sun's circuit, and wall< above the
moon3 that they should tell us the fize and form of the stars, as if they
werejust come down from them3 that those, who scarcely know how many
furlongs it is from Athens to Megara, should inform you exaitly how many
cubits distance the· sun is from the moon, should mark out the height of
the air, and the depth of the sea, describe circles, from squares upon tri·

God without admiration; but with how much more dignity are they confidered by the holy
Psalmist !

praise him all ye starem praise the Lord upon earth, ye dragous and all deep55 fite and hail,
