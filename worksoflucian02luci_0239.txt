Tus DOUBLEINDICTMENT. 233

not so much as admit me into their houses, where my enemy, Injustice,
has already met with a hearty welcome.
J U P 1 T E R.
They are not all so wicked: you will still find some, my dear daughter,
who are good and virtuous; but come, let us be gone, that we may-do a

little bufinessto-day· M E R C U R Y

Away, good Justice, towards Sunium3 go along under Hymetrus, and
leave Parthene on your left, where the two mountains are; you seem to have
forgot the way. How is this! crying and lamenting! never be afraid,
child, this is quite a different age3 the ἦ Scyrons, and Pityocampti‚ and
Bufiris’s, and Phalaris’s, whom you were so afraid of, are all dead and gone;
Wisdom now, and the Academy‚ and the Portico are all in all, they are

gave, changed their colour, and became perfectly good3 these are all fond
of, and ready to receive you: those who, from the dirt and filth they had
formerly contraited, could not take in enough of her salutary medicine,
were better than many others, but ssill weak and imperfect, still spotted,
like leopards, with vice and folly3 and some there are, who only ’ἦν touch-
ing the veffel it was prepared in, thought they had done enough. You,
