DEMONAX. 65

He did not, as it were, a cut off his philosophy from any particular piece,
but blended all the sects and opinions together, and nevi-r openly declarcd
which he was most attached to. He seemed‚ on the whole, rather partia!
to Socrates, though, in his habit and manner of living hc resembled Dio-
genes; not that, with regard to diet, he carried things to extremity, that
he might be gazed at and admired, but eat and drank like other people,
without pride and ostentation, affociated with all, both public and private.
His conversation was full of Attic grace, without the mixture of Socratic
irony, so that those who kept him company never either contemned his ad·
vice, or dreaded the severity of his reproofs, but were always agreeably im-
proved, growing more decent and orderly‚ as well as more chearful, and
forming better hopes of an hereafter.

Ι He was never noisy or quarrelsome, and though he would often chide,
was never angry3 he was severe on the offence‚ but pardoned the offender,
like the good phyfician, who heals the distemper, without fretting at the
patient: to commit fauks, he thought was human, to repent of, and cor-
re& them, was divine. Living in the manner he did, he never wanted
any thing for himself, but always endeavoured to provide his friends with
what was necessary: but when they were exalted with the good things of
life, he would remind them how frail and tranfitory they were; and when
they complained of penury, banilhment, diseases, or old age, would corn-
fort them, by observing with a smile, that what afflicted them would soon-
be gone and past, that in a short time there would be no more remember-
ance either of good or evil, but all would enjoy a long and lasting freedom.
His constant employment was to reconcile contending brethren‚ and make
peace between man and wife. &Vhen the people mutinied and rebelled, he
interposed seasombly, and prevailed on the greater part of them to submit,
and lend all reasonable aflistance to their country. Such was his philosophy,
gentle, mild, chearful, and benignant; nothing deeply affe&cd him but
the disorder or death of a friend, as he esteemed friendihip the greatest bleff-
ing of life; he was himself therefore kind and benevolent to all: to be a
† man was a sufficient title to his regard and affection, nor did he withdraw·

⁸ cut qff] Greek, εκ ἔν αποτεμνομενος, the idea of cutting off a piece of philosophy, like a bit
esdoth, from another man’s cont, is extremely droll, and quite in Lucian's besl manner ; some
critics, notwithstanding, have told us that Demonax was not written by him,

†A mam] Homo sum, huma'ni nihilame alienum puto. Ter.
