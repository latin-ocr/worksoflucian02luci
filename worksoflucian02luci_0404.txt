vivcd many more, if he had not been taken prisoner in the battle against
Perdiccas, and condemned to the cross. The Elder Cyrus, king of Persia,
according to the monumental inscriptions, (and this is confirmed by Onesi-
critus, who wrote the life of Alexander‚) when he was a hundred years old,
ι meeting with one of his friends, whom he had been long in search of, and
hearing from him that many persons had been put to death by his son Cam-
byses, who reported that it was done by order of his father, partly on ac·
count of his son’s cruelty, and partly because he had been himself accused of
conniving with him, died of grief. Artaxerxes, surnarned Mnemon, on ac-
count of his extmordinary mcmory, ,whom the Younger Cyrus wagcd war
with, died at eighty-six, Dinon says ninety-four. Another king of Persia
ofthc sime name, who, as Isidorus thc historian repens, reigned in his
time, was cut oss by trcason at the age of ninety-three, his brother Gofi-
thres conspiring against him. Sinarthocles, king of the Parthians, on his
return from Scythia, took poffeffion of his kingdom at fourscore, and reigned
seven years: and Tigranes, king of Armenia, who went to war with Lu-
cullus, was eighty—five when hc died. Hyspafines, who ruled over the
Characians and other people bordering on the Red Sea, lived to the same
age: and Tiraeus, the third king from him, was carried off by a disease at
ninety-two. Artabazus, the seventh sovereign from Teraeus, was brought
into the kingdom by the Parthians at eighty—fix, when he began his reign.
Mnasires, likewise, another king of that nation, lived to ninety-fix. Mafi-
nissa, king of Numidia, arrived at his ninctieth year. That Asander, whom
'Augustus made gove‘rnor of the Bosphorus, fought both on foot and horse-
back at the age of ninety, and was inferior to none3 three years after he
starved himself to death, being piqued at the citizens for deserting him, and
going over to Scribonius. Isidorus, the Caracenian, tells us, that Goefius,
who was his cotcmporary, and king of the Omanians in Arabia Felix, lived
to a hundred and fifteen: these are all the princes whom history has ccle-
brated for their longevity.

But as many philosophers, and men of letters, who take more care of
themselves, have also lived ro a great age, I shall endeavour, as far as any
records wil} supply us with information, to enumerate them. And first, for
the philosophers : Democritus os Abdera, was turned of a hundred and four,
when he voluntarily abstained from all food, and died. Xenophilus, the
