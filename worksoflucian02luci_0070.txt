64 DEMONAX.

and admired, particularly the latter, with whom Ι was for a long time inti,
matcly acquainted. Concerning the former, Ihavc treated in another book,
wherein 1 described his immense fize, aud incredible strength, his living iu
the open air on Parnassus, and feeding on what the woods afforded him, his

clearing the road of robbers, building bridges, mending impaffable ways,
and other labours not unworthy of his great * predecessor.

With regard to Demonax, 1 think it highly necessary to make-honour-
able mention of him, for two reasons ; first, because Ι should wish, as far as
in me lies, to deliver down the memory of him to posterity3 and secondly,
because it would be a recommendation of philosophy to our young nobilsty,
to set before them not only the examples of antiquity‚ but to give them a
recent model for their imitation in our own times„ in the life of the best phi-
losopher, whom 1 have ever seen or known,

He was born at Cyprum, of parents not mean or obscure, 'but distinguished
by their wealth and dignity; aspiring himself to much greater honours by
the search after every thing that was good and beautiful, he applied himself
early to the study of philosophy!a not from the example of ’ᾗ Agathobulus‚
ξς Demetrius, or Epist-etus, all whom he knew and was conversant with; nor
Η Timocrates the Heracliam so famous for his wisdom and eloquence, but
excited by the love of honour and virtue„ the paffions of his earliest youth,
he looked with contempt on all the pleasures of human life, and attached
himself to liberty and truth ; living a sober and irreproachable life, and set-
ting an example of prudence and wisdom to all who saw and heard him.
Nor did lie enter upon it, as they say, with unwassxed fect, but was familiar
with the poets, and had most part of their works by heart3 had not lightly
{kinimed over the tenets of the several faits of philosophers‚ or only touched
them, as the common exprcffien is, with the tip of his finger, but knew
them all perfeitly; keeping his body, at the same time, in proper exercise,
and inured to labour. His ambition was not to be deficient in any thing
which any body excelled in; insomuch, that when he found he was no longer
equal to himself, he quitted life of his own accord, leaving to the principal ’
persons in Greece, much to be said concerning him.
