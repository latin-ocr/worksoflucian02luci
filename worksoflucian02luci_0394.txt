pride; it calls for the admiration of no vulgar speffihttor, but of the tasteful
and ingenious, who relies not on his sight, buton his judgrnent; it looks
towards the early, which is, doubtless, the most beautiful part of the day,
and fronts the rising sun, receiving at its open doors an abundance of ligh't.
Thus the ancients always built their temples. The length, breadth‚ and
height of the apartmentS, are constru&ed in due and regular proportion;
the windows large, and disposed according to the various feasons of the year,
all admirably contrived, both for pleasure and convenience; in the cieling
are no superfluous ornaments, nothing can be found fault with3 the gold
and decorations, not heaped on, but used with judgment and discretiori.
Like a beautiful but modest woman, who sets off her charms with a small
necklace, a pretty ring on her finger, or ear-rings in her ears, a fillet to bind
her flowing hair, or a buckle to fasten her zone; these add grace to the form,
as purple to a garment : whilst harlots‚ especially if they are not over hand·
some, will have their garments all purple, and necklace all gold to heighten
their charnis, endeavouring to supply their want of beauty by something exter-
nal, that mayattra& and delight; they think that arm must be thought white,
that is covered with gold ; and that the soor, which is not so well made, may
be well concealed by a golden ssipper3 and that the face itself will appear
more agreeable, if their whole dress is splendid and magnificent. They al-
ways, therefore, adorn themselves in this manner3 but the modest and deli-
cate sair one, makes use only of so much gold and jewels as is necessary and
sufficient, nor will she blush to shew her beauty naked and unadorned. In
like manner, this house, which is beautiful in itself‚ has only so much orna·
ment as is necessary and becoming, interspersed here and there: as the.
stars appear in the heavens at proper distances, for if the whole was one
blaze of light, it would not be pleafing, but terrible to us; even so the gold
here is not superfluous, or put on merely for shew and finery, but shines
with a soft and pleafing splendour, diffufing a redness over the whole3 for
when the light strikes in upon the gold, the colours blend together, and
form a kind of double day. The upper parts of this Palalce, are such, in· “
deed, as call for the pen of Homer to describe them; he, perhaps, would
say, ἠὲ it was lofty — like the bed of Helen, or νίν- like Olympus splendid.—
