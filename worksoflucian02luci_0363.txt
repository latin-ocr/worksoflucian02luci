What you can hope to get from books Icannot conceive, and yet you
are always poring over them for ever, tying, binding, oiling‚ and casing
and preserving them with cedar and saffron, as if you could remp any :idwin-

ancients, to speak end to do what is right, to be ambitious of good and fly
from evil; and if we gain neither of these, what use can books be of, butro
find employment 'for mice, afford a habitation for moths, or get poor ser-

much redundancy and repetition of the same sentimum, a fault which Lucian is sometimes
guilty of3 but ifan authorwill repeat, the transsator is bound in honour to repeat after him ; the
