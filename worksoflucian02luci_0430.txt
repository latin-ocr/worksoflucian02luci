sanne, see, 1 bend niy head, place my handsbehind 1116, and worship your
tiara ; but, for heaven'> sake, give your troop to one of these strong fellows
here in uiy 116311ς for I abhor riding, and never was on horseback in my
life. 1 3111 afraid, when the trumpet suunds to battle, Ι should dread being
thrown off 31111 trod under font by so many hoofs, or that some fiery horse
should run away with 1116 into the mitist of the enemy, and I must be tied
tu the saddlc, or lhouid never he able to hold the rein.

cirriages, the Cenchreans having already provided corn, shipping, and
every thing for us, we sail through the EEgean into Ionia; then, sacrificing
