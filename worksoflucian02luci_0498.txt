you mean, or of whom ?'' “ And do you, wretch, replied the Platonic,
pretend to talk?'' Dionyfidorus was now running into abuse, when His-
tiaeus the grammarian, like a good man, put a stop to it, by crying out,
“ No more of this; I am going to repeat my Epithalamium.” And accord.
ingly he began3 if I remember right, it ran thus :

ἦ Here was brought up, Cleanthis the divine,
Nor Venus, nor the Moon, is half so fine ;
Hail, thou too beauteous bridegroom, far more fair
Than Neleus, or Achilles, ever were :
For you, the bridal hymn we will prepare,
And strive to celebrate the happy pair.

The repetition of these verses was followed, as we may well suppose, by
a loud laugh ; and the time now approached for taking away the vffikuals ε
this was very peaceably done by Eucritus and Aristaenetus, Chaerea, Ion,
Cleodemus, and myself3 but Diphilus was for carrying off Zeno’s ssmre,
which had been placed before him, as well as his own, and fought with the
servants about it; he got hold it on one fide, whilst the man pulled on the
other, and the hen was dragged' about from fide to fide, like the bo'dy of
Patroclus ; at length he was overpowered, and forced to give it up3 at
which he was not a little incensed: all this was matter of mirth and laughter
to the company.

Hermon and Zenothemis, as Ι before observed to you, sat next to each
other ; at first they took very quietly their several portions; but a fat bird being
by chance set close to Hermon, (mark, I beseech you, this circumstance, for
now our affairs draw to a crifis‚) Zenothemis quits his own, and endeavours
to seize that which belonged to Hermon, and which he as strenuoussy held
srom him; a great clamour immediately arose3 they fell upon each other,
tofl'ed the birds into one another's faces, and each seized his antagonist by
the beard, and called out for help. Cleodemus flew to the affistance of Her-
mon, Alcidamas and Diphilus took the part of Zenothemis. The philoso-
phers, in short, all ranged themselves on one fide or the other, except Ion,
who stood neuter. The rest proceeded to blows3 when Zenothemis, taking
up a large cup that stood before Aristaenetus, threw it at Hermon.
