THEFUGITIVES. 455

M E R C U R Y.
Very true : but who are these that seem to be looking about for some-

body? they are coming up, as if they wanted to ask a question of us,

P A S S E N G E R.
Have any of you seen three impostors going this way, in company with a
woman ἥθ’ ssiaved close in the Spartan manner, who has a masculine appear-

ance, and looks like a virago ?
P H Ι L O S O P H Y.

They seem to be in search of the same persons as we are.

P A S S E N G E R.
The same as you? our's are all fugitives; but it is the woman we want

most, whom these fellows have run away with.
M E R C U R Y.
You shall know what we want them for presently: come, we will cry

them for you.
Ο yes! <if any person can discover a Paphlagonian ssave from Sinope,

whose ἡ* name fignifies Riches, with a pale face, a long beard ssiaved close,
a bag in his hand, aud covered with an old cloak3 paffionate‚ illiterate, and
has a rough voice; whoever can produce such a one, shall be rewarded ac-

cording to law.
F U L L E R.

I do not know who you mean by these marks 3 the man Ι am in search of
is a fuller by trade, he worked in my shop, wore his own hair, and his name

was Cantharus.
P H I L O S O P H Y.

It is the same for all that3 he was your servant, and a fuller, but now he

appears like a philosopher.
F U L L E R.

O the impudence of the fellow! so now he calls himself a philosopher, aud
troubles himself no more about me: but we shall find him out amongst us.

⁸ Shavcd close] Respicit ad Laconum rnorem, quo virgines matrimonium initurae, ut ami-
culo virili afferonuba induebantur, ita quoque ad cutem usque ficut viri radibantur. Plut. in
Lyc. See also Meurfius in Misc. Luc.

ἦ· thfe namen] Lucian is here supposed to glauce at some ssave or low fellow, who had as-
sumed the name and character of Epieietus. The masser, who is a fuller, is surprised to find
his servant had taken another name, and was turned philosopher. Many au honest tradesman
amongst uS, has, in like manner, been surprised on miffing his ’prentice, to hear of his turning
divine, and harranguing the populace in the charaCter of a Field Preacher, at Whitfield or Wes-

ley’s tabernacle.
