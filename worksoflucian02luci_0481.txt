SATURNALIAN EPISTLES. 475

will celebrate my festival as you ought, when you recolledt that you must
all soon quit this life, when the rich must part from their riches, and you
from your poverty. I ssia'll write, however, rothem as Ι promised, andI
make no doubt but they will pay a proper regard to my letter.

SATURN‚ ⁷ro THE RICH, SENDS HEALTH.

Ι HAVE just now received a letter from the Poon, complaining that you
give them nothing: they intreat me, therefore, to establish an equality
amongst men, and to make all things common to all, that every one may
have a part3 saying, that it is unjust sor one man to have more than is ne—
ceffary; and another, nothing that is pleasant or agreeable. To which I an-
swered, that all these things belonged to Jupite'r3 but that, with regard to
the present time, or any injuries which were done to them during my festi-
val, Ishould take them under consideration, and would write to you about
it. What they require of you is, I think, very reasonable3 for how, say
they, starving as we are with eold and hunger, shall we be able to keep the
festival? If, therefore, Iwould have them partake of it, they desire Ι would
ι lay my commands on you, to give thern some of your cloaths‚ such as were
not fit for you, or which you had no occafion for, together with a little of
your spare money. This, if you would agree to, they will not complain of
you to Jupiter3 but, if you deny thern, they are resolved to petitiou him for
a new distribution, the first time he sits to do justice. This, indeed, t think
you rnay very easily do, out of the abundance which you poffess. With re-
gard to suppers, they request, that they may partake of thern, and that you
will not shut your doors against thern, and feast by yourselves: whenever,
which, it seems, happens but seldom, you do invite them, they have more
uneafiness than joy or pleasure, as they are sure to meet with a thousand af·
fronts and indignities, ‘and particularly that of being served with worse wine
than what you drink yourselves: heavens! how mean and illiberal is this!
I wonder theydo not rise up frorn table, and take their leave of you immedi-
ately. Then again, even of this they are not suffered to drink as much as

they like ι; your cup-bearers, like the ⁴⁴⁶ companions of Ulyffes, seal up their
