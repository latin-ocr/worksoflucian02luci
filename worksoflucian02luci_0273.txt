TnePARASITE. 257

and Demosthenes, who were so much braver, who were always abufing
Philip, and ssirring up the people against him in their harangues, what
mighty a& 'did they perform against him when the war began ? Hyperides
and Lycurgus never so much as dared to put their heads out beyond the city
walls, but sculked behind thern, and during the fiege, contentcd themselves
with making little speeches and decrees against him3 whilst their great
*lenden who was always crying out “ Philip, that plague of Macedon,
from whom no man would even purchase a ssave.¹' After venturing as far as
Boeotia, before the battle began, threw down his sstield, and fled. This
you must have heard, as it is universally known, not by Athenians only, but
by the Thracians and Scythiam, those barbarians from whom this coward
sprung.

I acknowlege it; but these were only orators‚ people employed to teach

language and not virtue; what say you to philosophers ? you cannot accuse

them.

These, Tychiades, though they are perpetually talking about fortitude,
and hackneying the name of virtue, are more timid and cowardly even than
our orators: who ever heard of a philosopher dying in battle ? they either
never fought at all, or if they did, took the first opportunity to run away.
Antisthenes, Diogenes, Crates, zeno, Plato, AEsehines‚ Aristotle, and the
whole tribe of them, never so much as saw an engagement. The wise So-
crates alone ventured to a battle, but was glad to retreat from ⁴⁶ Parnethe to
the palaestra of Taurea; he thought it much pleasanter and more polite to di-
vert himself with the young men, and throw out his jests and sarcasms, than
to fight with the Spartans.

-i- Parnethe.] Socrates, in spite of what is here roundly asserted by Lucian‘s Parasite, was no
coward3 but, according to Plutarch’s testimony, always behaved well in battle, so well, in-
deed, that an honourable reward was assigned to him by the general, which he declined in fa-
vour of his friend Alcibiades. With regard to the affair here alluded to, Lucian has miste-
presented it; for, as Plutarch tells us, in his tra& concerning the daemon of Socrates, as the
army came to a way that was divided into two, Socrates made a stand, and advised those that
were with him not to take the path they were going into, along the mountain Parne, but the
other, by the way called Retiste, for sneh, said he to them, was the daemon's advice; most of
thern, however, perfisted in their own opinion, were met by a party of horsemen, and all cut
off. Socrates, and those who followed him, got safe horne.

This, surely, was prudence, and not cowardice. We must not always depend on my friend
Lucian’s veracity.
