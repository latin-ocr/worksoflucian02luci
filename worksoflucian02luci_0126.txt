120¹ TOXARIS.

with whom hc had formerly lived, succeeded to the empire: he returned,
therefore to his own country, and having got together a large army, made
an irruption through the mountains into Scythia: Eubiotus also, not long
after, invaded us, bringing all his Greci-ans, together with the Alani, and
Sauromates, making about twenty thousand, the forces of Eubiotus and
Adyrmachus united, formed together an army, of not less than ninety thou-
sand men,a third part of which were archers, who fought on horse-back. We,
for Ι was myself at that battle, furnishing a hundred horse at my own expence,
having collee‘oed about thirty thousand forces, made head against them un-
der Arsacomas3 an'd when we saw them advancing‚ sent out a party of our
horse to attack them. The battle was hardly fought for a long time, till in
the end our troops began to give way: our phalanx was broken, and the
whole Scythian army cut, as it were, into two parts 3 one of which, partly
subdued, saved themselves by a retreat, and the Alani did not choose to
pnrsue them; the other, which was the smaller division, was soon inclosed,
and totally surrounded by the Alani and the Machlinians, who, by their darts
and arrows, made great ssaughter amongst u-s. *Thus locked in on every
side, we were in the greatest distress, and many laid down their arms.
Amongst these unfortunate victims, were Lonchates and Macentes‚ who',
ν exposing themselves bravely to every danger, were both wounded, Loncha-
tes in the thigh, and Macentes in the shoulder with a spear, and likewise on
the head by a battle-am which being perceived by Arsacomas, who was
then with us, and who could not bear the thought of deserting his friends,
he set spurs to his horse, and brandishing his swerd, rode so furioussy through
the enemies rankS, thar the Machlinians‚ unable to refist his impetuofity, gave
way, and let him pass quite up to them. He recovered the wounded heroes,
and exhorting them to join him, rushed upon Adyrmachus, and with one
blosr of his sword, clave ,him in two. On the death of their leader, the sol-
diets soon turned their backs and fied; as did, in a little time after, both
the Alani and the Grecians. Thus were we once more vietorious, pursuing
and killing numbers, till night coming on, put an end to the ssaughter.
The next day we received ambassadors from them with terms of peace; the
people os Bosphorus submitted to pay us double tribute, the Machlinians
offered hostages, and the Alani, to make us amends for this invafion, promis·
ed to reduce the Sindians, who had long held out against υς, to obedience.
On these conditions ive were prevailed on, in compliance with the opinion of

Arsacoma s,
