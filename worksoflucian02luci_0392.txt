ENCOMIUM ON A HOUSE.

It was customary, in Lucmn’s Time, for the Rhetoricians, or Orators by
Profhffion, to declat'm on any given Sulgjet‘t at the Command of their Superiars,
eeither in public or private3 and to this we may attribute the following De-
clamation, in Praise offhme House (wheje it was we know not), probabhr by
Defire of the Master and his Friends, before whom the Orator was to shew his
Skill, by an extempore Speech on the Occafion. It is written, more especially the
fi'st Part of it, in a Kind of flowing measured Prqse, approaching to Blank
Verfl’, and much refimbling the Style of Lord SHAFTESBURY. The whinfical
change of Perfhns, and LUC1AN'5 anfwering himself in the latter Part of this
little Piae, one cannot J& easily account for. T he whole, however, is singular and
entertaining, particularly the Description of the Putares in the Concluston. Lu-
C1AN (for this Piece is undoubtedly his), had a warna and poetical Imagination,
and seems here more peculiarly to indulge it; I have therey‘bre adopted his Style,
and endeavour’d to give the Translation that Glow ospoetical Colouring which the
Reader of T aste cannot fail to observe and admira in the Original.

O delightsul did the charming Cydnus appear to Alexander, its stream

so bright and pleasant, so refressiing in a hot summer, though swift not
rapid, and though deep not dangerous‚ that he could not refrain from
bathing in it, nor would he deny himself the pleasure, though he contra&ed
a disorder by indulging himself in it: and shall not the fight ofa noble pa-
lace, beautiful to the eye, light, chearful, and magnificent, strining with
gold, and adorned with the finest pielures, inspire a man (especially an ora-
tor by profeffion,) to dislinguish himself by some description of it, some en-
comium on it, to make himself known, and, like his subjeet, to become con-
spicuous? away with all such as only look over and admire without praifing3
to be silent is injurious; ir. looks like envy and ill-nature; it ill becomes the
rnan of taste‚ who is smitten with the love of all that is great and beautiful.
It shews a stupid rusticity, a disregard for merit, ‘and a contempt of the
Muses themselves, not to know that the learned and the unlearned consider
speetacles of this kind in very different lights: one is contented to look
round, and lift up the hand with admiration, to gaze in silence at every
thing, as if afraid, that all they could say in praise of it, would be less than
