terrible menace, and saying that Pontus was full of atheists and Christiana,
who had dated to spread evil reports concerning him : whom therefore, he
commanded the people to stone and drive out of the city, if they ever ex-
pected the deity would be propitious to them. With regard to Epicurus,
he delivered the following oracle: being asted what he did in the shades
below, he answererl„ Ἰ hat he wore lcaden fetrers there, and stuckin the ¹* mud.
Can you wonder at the success of the oracle, which gave such shrewd and
senfible answers? with Epicurus and his follow-era, indeed, he waged perpetual
war; they were irreconcilable enemies, and with very good reason; for whom
must an impostor like him, the lover of prodigies, and the foe of truth, more
justly abhor and detest, than that philosopher who so well understood the
nature of things, and alone discovered what was true and genuine in them.
With the Platonics, Stoics‚ and Pythagoream, it was all profound peace 3
but the inflexible Epicurus, for so he always called him, was his most bitter
adversary, constantly laughing at, and turning all his frauds and tricks to

Once, indeed, at the request ofa senator’s brother, he attempted it3 but whe-

He would often, as 1 before observed‚ {hew the serpent to such as begged'
to see it3 not the whole indeed, but only the tail and the rest of the body,
keeping the head in his bosom, where it was concealed. But, having now a
mind to stri'ke the multitude with something more than ordinary, he told'
them the god would speak himself, and deliver his oracles by- word of
mouth, without the affistance of his prophet. This was easily done, by
means of the wind-pipes of cranes so fastened to the {ham head, as by a
voice placed without, to convey the sound through the linen mouth of AEscu·
lapius. These were called Autophoni, or the vocal oracles, and were not
