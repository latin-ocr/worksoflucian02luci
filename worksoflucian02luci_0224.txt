218 ICARO-MENIPPUS.

Ι must own I was frightened‚ and took him for some daemon of the moon3
bnt he carne up to me, and cried out, “ Menippus, don't be afraid,
””·’» Ι arn no god, why call’st thou me divine?

I am Empedocles the naturalist: after 1 had leaped into the fflrnace, a va-
pour from AEma, carried me up hither‚ and here Ι live in the moon, and
feed upon dew: Ι arn come to free you from your present distress.” “ You
are very kind, said I, rnost noble Empedocles, and when 1 fly back to Greece,
1 ssiall not forget to pay my devotions to you in the tunnel of my chirnney
every new moon.‘' ‘⁴ Think not, replied he, that Ι do this for the sake of
any reward Ι might expe& for it; by ἦν Endymion, that is not the case, but Ι
was really grieved to see you so uneasy : and now, how shall we contrive to
make you see clear?” “ That‚ by J0ve, said 1, Ι cannot guess, unless you
can take off this mist from my eyes, for they are horribly dirn at present;
you have brought the remedy along with you.” “ How so !”—“ Have you not
got an eagle’s wing ?’'—“True, but what has that to do with an eye ?'’-“ An
eagle, you know, is inore sharp-fighted than any other creature, and the on-
ly one that can look against the sun : your true royal bird is known by never
winking at the rays, be they ever so strong-’'—“ Sol have heard, and Ι am
sorry Ι did not, before Icame up, take out my own eyes and put in the
engle'53 thus imperfe&, to be sure, Iam not royally furnished, but a kind of
bastard bird.'‘—-·“ You may have one royal eye, for all that, if you please3 it
is only when you rise up to fly, holding the vultur's wing still, and rnoving
the eagle’s only3 by which means, you will see clearly with one, though not
at all with the other.”—“That will do, and is sufficient for me3 I have often
seen siniths, and other ariists, look with one eye only, to make their work
the truer.'' This conversation ended, Empedocles vanished into smoke, and
Isaw no more of him. Ι aeted as he advised me, and no sooner moved my
eagle's wing, than a great light came all around me, and I saw every thing
as clear as poffible : looking down to earth, I beheld distinffly cities and
rnen, and every thing that pafl'ed amongst them; not only what they did

openly, but whatever was going on at home, and in their own houses, where
they thought to conceal it. l saw ss Ptolemy committing incest with his
