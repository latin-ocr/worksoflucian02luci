aster she had infee‘ced his mind with this poison; for never in 'his sober senses
would he have listened to her. But why should 1 be angry with ber for abus-
irzg me, when she spares not even the gods, but arraigns their pnwidence,
and deserves, therefore, to be punished sor her impiety Ξ Ι hear she does not
mean to answer for herself, but has hired Epicurus to plead for her; in such
contempt does she hold the seat of judgment: but ask her, lintreat you,
what she thinks Hercules, and your Theseus would have been, if they had
fied from labour, and followed the camp of pleasure; the earth had then
been full of nothing but injustice and oppression. This is all 1 shall observe
to you, as Ι am not fond of long speeches, though, if she thought proper,
to enter into a dispute with rne, I could soon shew you how little she has to
say for herself; but you will remernber your oath, and proceed to your suf-

for many arguments3 if Pleasure has in reality made use of any poison-5 or

as an enchantress, and punished accordingly: but if, on the other hand, a
free man, in a free city, disgusted at the sourness of the P0rtico, and finding
that feliciry, which it promised, only an idle pretence, should quit its crook-
ed pardis, and labyrinths of argument, and shake off its chains, should con-
fider man, not as a stock or stone, labour as it really is, an evil, and plea-
sure as it always must be, sweet and agreeable3 must such a man, because
just escaped from a ship-wreck he would swim into the haven, be forced into
incessant toil, and given up a victim to despair, when he fled for refuge to
the arms of Pleasure, like a suppliant at the altar of mercy? or should he la-
bour perpetually in search os that great and celebrated object virtue, and
spend a whole life of misery and sorrow here, in hopes of happiness hexeafss
ter? could any man determine more properly than he did, who, though he
was well acquainted with all the Stoic doctrines, and acknowleged, that
what was honest, could alone be good3 yet found that labour was a real

evil, and made choice of that which experience taught him was the best.
