LAPITHAE,on-rnssBANQUET. 49¹

“ Do you do it, said the other.’' Thus they were going on, when Ion
stepped forth, and said, “ Permit me to propose something more worthv of
this solemnity, and proper for the oecafion; let every one of us, without
farther contention‚ entertain the company by haranguing on some subjeet,
in the manner of Plat0.” This motion was applauded by every body, par-
ticularly by Arestaenetus and Eucritus, who hoped, by this means, to get
rid of the noise and tumult which were so disagreeable: Arestaenetus, there⁴
fore, retired to his own place, imagining that every thing would now be
quiet.

And now came on what we call the finishing course, when every one has a
hen, a piece of boar, a hare, a fried fifh, a corn—cake, and some sweet·
meats, and these were to be carried home: every dish, however, was be-
tween tWO, and every body was to take what was put before him; there was
a mess for Aristaenetus and Eucritus; Zenothemis and Hermon had lilzewise
one; there was one for Cleodemus and Ion whonsat next to him, and an·
other for the bridegroom and myself3 Zeno being gone off, Diphilus had a
whole one. Be sure you observe these things, my friend, for they are ne-
cefl'ary to what I shall tell you by and by.

Ion then proceeded, and began thus; ‘⁶ Since, said he, you insist on my
speaking first, be it so: before this learned company, it may, perhaps, be
expe&ed, that 1 should say something concerning ideas, incorporea] sub-
stances, or the immortality of the soul; to prevent, notwithstanding, any
disputes that may arise from such as differ with me in opinion on these sub-
jefts, l shall speak concerning nuptials, as a theme more suita'ole to the pre-
sent oecafion. Better, undoubtedly, it were for mankind, according to So-
crates and Plato, that we should never have any nuptials at all, but confine
ourselves, like Plato and Socrates, to our own sex, as those only who do
this, can arrive at perfect virtue: but if we must have women and matri-
mony, let the wives of philosophers, as the great Plato has decreed, be in
common, to avoid jealousy.”

Upon this, a loud laugh ensued, as what had been said seemed rather un-
seasonable in such company, and on such an Occafion. “ Will you never,
cried Dionyfidorus, leave off talking such nonsense to us ἓ What jealousy do
