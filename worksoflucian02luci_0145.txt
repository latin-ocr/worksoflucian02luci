Reflee'ting now on the many misci-ies I had suffered fincc my transstn'nm-
tion, I could not help attempting to cry out, ‘⁶ O Jupiter, thou art tor>
patient,” but alas! my voice failed, and I could only bray. lt happened
just at this time, that some countryinen who had lost their ass. and were in
search of it; hearing me cry out, came in without any leave or notice, tak-
ing me for the beast they were looking for, and caught my lewd masters do—
ing what they should not do, which they took care in the neighbourhood to
