is no music, vocal or instrumenta13 but at Juno's they sing, and play on
fiutes and cymbals, during the whole ceremony. With regard to this dif.
serence, they could affign no reason to be depended on.

There is a lake, not far from the temple, in which are kept a great nurn—
ber of sacred fifh, of various kinds ; some of them grow to a prodigious fize:
these have names given them, and will come when they are called. 1 saw
one with a gold fret-work of flowers hung round his fins. This lake is ex-
tremely deep : I did not fathom it, but, they say, it is four or five thousand
feet. In the midst of it is an altar of stone-which you would think, at first
sight, was floating on the water, but, 1 believe, is supported by great pil-
lars underneath: it is always adorned with garlands, and persumed. Num-
bers of people‚ with erowns on their heads, swim to, and put up their
prayers at it, every day. There are, befides, very frequently large affemblies
here, which they call the descent to the lake, when Juno first appears to the
fifh, to prevent Jupiter from seeing them, which is he did, they say, all
would perifh immediately: Jupiter, however, comes, as intending to look
upon them, but is driven back by her with many prayers and supplications.

But the greatest ceremony is that which they observe by the sea-fide, con—
cerning which Ι can affirm nothing of my own knowlege, never having been
present at it. What they do in their return from ir, Ι was myself an eye-

is sealed up with wax ; they are not suffered themselves to take off the seal,·
but one of the galli, who lives near the lake, takes it off, and opens the
veffel, for which he has a certain stipend : these priests get a great deal of
money by it. From thence they bring the water into the temple, and pour
it out; the sacrifice is performed, and they return.

But their greatest festival is celebrated early in the spring : it is called the
Torch, or the Funeral Pile. They cut down a number of large trees, which
they plant in an outer court of the temple; then get together a quantity of
goatS, sheep, and other cattle, which they hang alive upon the branches;
to these they add birds also, with garments, and works of gold and filver of
various kinds: when every thing is thus prepared, a fire is kindled under
the trees, and the whole burned to ashes. This is done in the presence of
their gods, whom they bring along with them, to be witneffes of the cere-
mony, attended by all Syria, and the regions round about, who take the
statues of their desties, and transport them thither. On certain stated days, ,
