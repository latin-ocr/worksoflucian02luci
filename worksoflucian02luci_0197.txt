TneCOCKANo TnssCOBLER. ¹9¹

M Ῑ C Y L L U S·
O heaven! this is more miraculous than ever, a philosopher turned cock!

But inform me, good son of Mnesarchus, how -you came to be changed
frorn a man into a bird, and, instead ofa ²¹² Samian, to be a † Tanagraeum
there is very little probability in all this, especially, when Ι perceivc two
things in you, that suit but ill with a Pythagoras. '

COCK.

What are they?
M Ι C Y L L U S.

One is, that you are talkative and clamorous, whilst he enjoined a five
year's filence; and the other is directly contrary to his laws3 for yesterday,
whenI carne horne, 1 had nothing to give you but a few beans, which you
devoured without scruple or hefitation: either, therefore, you have told a
falsehood‚ and must be sornebody else, or, if you are Pythagoras, have vio-
lated your own command, and done as wicked a thing, in eating beans, as
if you had dined upon your father’s head.

C O C K.
You are unacquainted, Micyllus, with the reason of all this, and seem
not to know what the different stations of life required. I eat no beans then,

· because Iwas a philosopher; but now Ι am a Cock, they are not forbidden.

Attend nour, and learn, how from Pythagoras Ι came to be what I arn, the
various beings which I passed through, and what Ι suffered and enjoyed in

each of them.
M 1 C Y L L U S.

Proceed, Ι beseech you: it is impossible to say how much Ι long to hear
it all: I do not know whether I should not prefer it to the golden dream 1

just now waked frorn.
C O C K.

You dwell much upon xthis sarne dream, which has made a strong im-
preffion on you, and seem to recolledt, with pleasure, the fleeting happiness

which it bestowed.
M I C Y L L U S.

1 shall never forget it ε it has left behind a sweet drowfiness, that al-
most closes my eye-lids, and inclines me again to sseep; it is like the tick-
ling of a feather in one’s ear, and has almost set me a madding.

θ’ Α Samiam] Pythagoras was of Samos.

ἦ Α Tanagraeum] Tanagra, a town of Boeotia, on the EuripuS, was famous, as well as
Rhodes, for its excellent breed of game cocks. See L’Hist. des Inscript. διε. ·
