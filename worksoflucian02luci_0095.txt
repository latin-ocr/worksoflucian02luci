DEFENCEOF THE PORTRAIT. 89

bro-ad, another with the foce for being too long, and a third with something
else. When they wer< gone, he shut himselfup again, and corrected his
figure according *w tl nal observations on it; the opinion of numbers,
he thought, was by no means to be despised, and that many must of neceffity
judge better than one, even though he were a Phidias.

ThisI have faithfully delivered from her, and beg you will take the same
advice from your old friend and companion.

1 protest, P01ystratus, l did not know you were so great an orator3 you
havemade so long a speech, and brought so heavy a charge against my poor
book, that 1 shall never be able to answer it. But, let me tell you, it is
contrary to the usual form of proceeding, to pass sentence on 3 man before
the cause is tried, or his advocate appears for him. “ It is very easy, as the
proverb says, to win the tace when you run by yourself;'' and it is no won-
derl should be cast, when Ι had not the liberty to defend myself,· but what
was worst of all, you were, yourselves, both accusers and judges. What
arnI to do then ? must Ι submit to your decrees, or, like the poet of ἥ Hi-
mera, fing a palinodia3 οι· will you permit me to have a re-hearing Ρ

POLYSTRATUS.
By all means, if you have any thing proper to urge in your own behalf;
nor will you plead before enemies as you seem, to think uS‚ but amongst
your best friends; for‘myselss I am a party concerned, and shall be ready to

affistyou.

I am only sorry that she is not present, for now I must transmit my de-
fence by another hand3 however, if you will be as faithful a messenger from
me to her, as you were from her‘to rne, Ι will e’en cast the dye.

POLYSTRATUS.

Never fear that, Lycinus, I will repeat your speech like 3 good actor, you
may depend on it;* but be brief, Idesire, that I may be able to remember it.
L Y C Ι N U S.

So heavy an accusation will require a long defence, but sor your sake Ι
shall contra& it; tell her, therefore, this from me -——

³ Oinmcra] Stesichorus, the famous Siciliam lyric poet, who, having in one of his odes
taken some liberties with the charaeter of that immaculate lady, the celebrated Helen, was
punistied for it by her brothers with blindness. He made his peace, however, with their god-
strips, by recantinlg‚ in a palinodia, and, in conl'neqeuce of it, was restored to his sight.
