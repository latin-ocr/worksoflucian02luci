ENCOMIUMONAHOUSE. 387

it deserved : whilst the other, who undeistands that beauty which hc admires,
is not satisfied with feasting his eyes alone, cannot bear to be a dumb specta-
tor, but will endeavour, with all his powers, to describe and point out the
beauties of a fight so noble and delightful.

Nor is general praise alone sufficient; like that of the *ἓ young man, who
so admired the palace of Menelaus, and compared it's ivory and gold to the
beauties of heaven, as he had seen nothing on earth that was equal to ir.
The best way of praifing it, is to exert our eloquence in its favour on the
very spot, and before the most approved judges; and surely a beautiful
house, filled with admirers of the building‚ is the fittest place for such an ena
comium3 where the voice, as in caverns, is driven back, dwells on, as it
were, with pleasure, and repeats what is said in an elegant and muse-like re-
iteration : as it often happens amongst the high and craggy rocks, where the
found of the shepherd's pipe is reverberated. The vulgar tell us, that Echo
is a nymph who inhabits there, and answers the finger from her cave. The
subjecit, doubtless, must animate and inspire the speaker; its beauty paffes
through the eye into the soul, elevating and adorning the discourse. The
fight of the armour, we knOW, stirred up Achilles against the Trojans, and
when he tried thern on, they gave wings to his courage, and roused him to

plane-trees, the green turs, and clear fountains of IIyffus, were propitious to
the great Socrates; there sported he with his Phaedrus, there confuted Ly-
fias, there invited the Muses to follow him to his retreat, and teach him
to talk of love; nor did the old man blush to call in virgins to affist him ε
surely then, to a spot so charming as this, they will come uninvited.

We boast not here of {hades and plane—trees only3 Ilyffus we leave far be·
hind us, and even the palace of the Perfian monarch, which was admirable
only for its riches, without art, beauty, or proporti0n3 though shining with
gold and treasures‚ which the spectator beheld with envy, and the master
was deemed happy to poffess; but it had no real merit ε the Arsacidae never
studied the beautiful, nor cared whether the beholder was pleased and satis-
fied, they only wished to see him struck with astonishment ; for the Barbari-
ans consult finery and ssieW‚ much more than elegance and beauty. But this
charming manfion is ill-suited to Barbarian eyeS, to Perfian pomp, or kingly
