286 ANACHARSIS.

just, to attend to, and affist the common-weal, to live honestly, never to
seck after what is base or unworthy, or to commit violence on any man ε we
carry them to comedies and tragedies at our theatre, that whilst they behold
the virtues and vices of past times, they may, themselves, be attached to the
one, and avoid the other3 permitting our comic writers to expose and ridi-
cule the citizens; and this we do, as well for their sakes, who may grow
better by seeing themselves laughed at, as for that of the spe&ators in gene-
ral, who may thus escape being ridiculed for the like absurdities-

I have seen, 1 believe, what you call your tragedians and comedians3 the
former, l think, -have high heavy ssioes, gold sringes on their garments,
with great * helmcts on their heads, gaping immensely wide, and truly ridi-
culous 3 they made a prodigious noise, and contrived, heaven knows how, to
wall< in their † chopines ε it was, if1 remember right, at the feast of Bacchus,
where the comedians wore fhoes not quite so high, could fiand upon their
feet, and were more like human creatores, but their head-pieces were even
more ridiculous than the others, and the whole audience laughed at them,
though they looked very grave and melancholy at the high-hecled tragediam,
as if they were concerned at the load which they dragged after them,

It was *not their compaffion, my good friend, which made them so melan·
choly, but, probably, the story which the poet told of some ancient cala-
mity, which, repeated in a mournful tragic strain, drew tears from them:
at the same time, 1 suppose, you heard some playing on the fiute, and others
finging to it, standing in a ⁴, circle,; these, l affure you, have their use, for
by such allurements‚ the mind is ssiarpened, and the heart improved.

ἃ {Ji-lma] The ancient masque was a kind of casque or helmet, which covered the whole head,
generauly copied from the busta or statues of the personages represented ε in so extensive an area as
the Greek theatre, it might be necessary to exaggerate the features, and enlarge the form of the

affor. This, however, makes the nialk a proper subje& of ridicule, and Lucian has frequently
taken the liberty to laugh at it as such.

ἦ· Chopines] The cothurnus or buskin <vas a kind of large and high shoe, the sole of which,
being made or* very thick wood, raised the acffors to an ,extraordinary height, and made them ap-
pear exrremely tall. lt was, probably, of the sanie form as the high shoe, or piece of cork,
worn hythe Spanilh women, called a chephri, and which it should seem by a passage in Shak-
speare, was used on our own stage -‘⁵ Your ladyship (lays Hamlet to the player,) is nearer
heaven, than when l saw you lant by the altitude osa cliopine.⁷' Hamler, a& 11. scene 7.

⁴( In a circla] The chortis. For a full account of which, see the Dissertation on Ancient
Tragaly, prefixed to ni)- tranllurion or‘sophcclcs. octavo edition, vol. i. p. 22.
