And now, father, though I am but as a stranger here, 1 will venture -to
give you my opinion: Ι am for permitting the combatants to procced in
their controversy3 and ifI find things go wrong, I will, if you think proper,
pull the whole portico down upon the head of Darnis, that he may no longer
pour forth his abuse upon υς.

*³⁶ By Hercules, Hercules, this is rough work indeed, and rather † Boeo-
tian ; to destroy so many at once, together with the whole portico, Marathon,
Miltiades, Cynagirus and all ! how will future orators be able to adorn their
fine speeches, when these necessary ornaments are taken awayafl-om them?
when you were a living man, indeed, you might have done these things
perhaps, bnt fince you are become a god, you must know that the Fates
alone have it in their power, and we are incapable of performing them.

HERCULES.

piece of advice as suitable to old England at all times, as it could poffibly be to ancient Greece.

'r By Her [ιι cs. ] This was a common Grecian oath. The applyingit in conversation with
Hercules himself h is something laughable in it.

γ Ba otia ιιι. ] Boeotia a city of Greece, was unfortunately distinguished, though we know
not well on what foundation, for the ignorance and stupidity of 1ts inhabitants, andan ancient
Boeotian was supposed to have as littleo wit as a modern Laplander ε hence the epithet Boeotium
always signified heavy. A person os a clownish and aukward deponinent, was called sus
Boeotia, and Horace, speaking of a dull fellow, says,

Boeotum in crasso jurares aere natum.
Boeotia, in lhort, was the noll-and οἱ antiquity.
