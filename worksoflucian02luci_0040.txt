34 OnDANCING.

an Dactyli, wcll sszilled in military knowlege, who is said to have received
Mars from the hands of Juno, whilst he was yet a boy, though remarkably
strong and manly, and to have instrutsted him in dancing‚ even before he
taught him to fight; for this, as a reward, he was presented by Juno with a
tenth of the spoil which fell to the share of Mars in battle. I need not men-
tion to you the feasts of Bacchus, which, you well know, all confist in dances,
the principal os them the ³⁶ Cordax, the ψ ὃὶογηῐιὶε, and the 4 Emmeleia,

were so called from the Satyrs, priests of Bacchus, who invented them 3 by

these lie conquered the Tyrrheniam, Indians, and Lydiam, and obliged
those warlikc nations to carry the thiasus.

Take heed‚ therefore, my most extraordinary friend, that you are not·
guilty of impiety, in vilifying this divine and mystic art, praetised by so
many of the gods themselves, and dedicated to their service, and which, at
the same time, affords both profit and delight. When Iconfider (sor 1 must
once more recur to the poets), how great an admirer you are of Homer, and
Hefiod in particular, Ι am astonifhed to find your opinion so directly opposite
to them, who praise this art above all things. When Homer speaks of things
the most defireable, he mentions sseep, love, and harmony, and calls danc-
ing alone the §irreprehensible pleasure ι he bears testimony, you see, to the

excellency of song, which always accompanies my favour-ite art, and ex-

pressy says, that is irreprehensible, which you have dared to find fault with ς
and again, in another part of his poem, he says,

Η To some the powers of bloody war belong,
To some sweet mufic, and the charms of song-

Most delightful, indeed, are song and dance together, they are the sweetest
gift of heaven; the poet seems to have divided all things into two parts, war

and peace, and in oppofition to the former has contrasted these pleasures as>
the most delcetable.

³* Corrlax] This was a gay brisst dance, accompanied sometimes, we are told, with lewd
and wauton gestures, and belonged properly to comedy ; a learned writer on the subject calls it
genus ridiculae saltationis in comediis, quae turpiter lumbos spinamque quatiebat—approaching,

1 suppose, pretty nearly to the indecency of our modern stage-dancing; the Bacchanalia, or
feasts of Bacchus, consisted principally ofvarious dances.

† Sicynnusq This was a satirical dance, wherein the grave and brisst were intermixed.
ζ Emmclcia] This was a grave and solemn dance.
