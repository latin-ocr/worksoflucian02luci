‘80 THEPORTRAIT.

POLYSTRATUS‘

Yon, my friend, have only scen her once, glancing, like lightning by
you, and speak only, therefore, of that which struck you then, her exter-
nal foi‘m3 but you saw nothing of her mind, nor know how far that exceeds
it in every beauty. I am her countryman, am well acquainted with, and
have often converscd with her. You very well know, [prefer good-nature,
benevolence, magnanimity‚ learning, arrd wisdom, to beauty3 these, doubt-
less, are far superior, and not to esteem them so, were as absurd as to prefer
λ, the garment to the body which is cloathed in it. VVhere the virtues of the
mind and body are united in one person, there, and there only, is true beau-
ty. I could point out numbers whose form is excellent, but who disgrace it
by their nmuuel'5; whose beauty fades and dies away, the body confeffing,
as it were, by ii:- inducent actions, that it is ruled by the worst of mfflreffes,
an evil foul. Such women put mein mind of AEgyptian idolatry3 the tem-
ple is large and beautiful, adorned with precious stones, gold, and ρίξὶυτεες
whilst the god within, is, perhaps, an ape, an ibis, a goat, or a cat: of
these there are bnt too many amongst us. But beauty alone is not sufficient,
unless it is properly adorncd; ’4’- not by purple robes, by necklaces‚ or t0ys3
but by modesty, truth, benev-omme, phssanfflropy, and the rest of those vir· .
tues which crown the complete woman.

LYCINUS,

Yon, therefore, Polystratus, must give me description for description,
measure for measure, as they say, οι· rather something over (for you are

very well able) : let me have the portrait of her mind, that I may no longer
adnm-e only orie half of her.

POLYSTRATUS.

It is no srnall trial of skill which you have exaffled of me3 itis much eafier,
let me tell you, to praise that which every body has before their eyes, than
to describe that which cannot be seen by any; for my portrait, l must call
in the aid not of painters and statuaries only, but of philosophers also, that I

may finish the figure by theirrules, and according to the complete model of
antiquity.

'fl‘ Not bypurplffi ξξῖικ] “ ΧΥἰῑοΓε adorning (says a better moralist than Luciam), let it not be
that ontward adornitg ofplaiting the hair, and oswearing of gold, or of putting on ofappareh·
but let it be the hidden man of the beart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament
ofa meek and quiet spirit, which is in the fight ofGod of great price.”
