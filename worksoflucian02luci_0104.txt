tions, whether they are our friends; but when they are praise-worthy, con.
fidet them as our own. But that which above all excited our applause and
admiration of these men was, that they seemed to be the best friends that
ever lived3 the great legissators, appointed, as it were, by heaven, to teach
mankind how friends should a& in all ranks and circumstances of life ε and
therefore intitled to the praise and worship of every noble Scythian. What
they did for each other, and what they suffered, our ancestors ordered to be
engraved on a pillar of brass, in the Orffleum, and made a lgw that this
should be the first study of their children. Sooner would one of thern for-
gct the name of his father than the aets of Pylades and Orestes. On the
walls of the temple is painted, by ancient artists, the whole history, as en-
graved on the pillar. There you see Orestes sailing with his friend, his ship
split on the rock, himself taken, and Iphigenia preparing to sacrifice him ς
in another part he is represented freed from his chains, ssaying Thoas, and
several other Scythians: their setting sail with Iphigenia and the goddess;
the Scythians attempting to board the ffiip, and hanging on the rudder,
some wounded, and repulsed, others frightened, and swimming back to

love, and kindness, which they shewed for each other, we regarded as
something more than human, as proofs of a mind far superior to the gene·
rality of mankind, who, when the ‘'⁴'‘ wind sets fair, and the voyage is pros-
peroiffi, resent it highly if they are not admitted to a share in the happiness
os their friends, and yet, if it turns about, retire, and leave them alone,

fiuely improved upon it in his beautiful poem of Henry and Emma, where he makes his he-
roine say to her lover,

Did I but purpose to embatk with thee

On the smooth surface of a summer's sea,

While gentle zephyrs play in prosp’rous galee,
And fortune's favour fills the swelling sails,

But would forsake the strip, and make the shore,
When the winds whistle, and the tempests roar?
