take, as soon as they are capable of knowing what is good, to strengthcn
their bodies, and render them fit for labour, 1 shall acquaint you with the
reasons why we exercise them in this manner, not, as you will see, merely
for the sake of the reward, for that a few only can obtain, but with the
view to a much greater advantage arifing to the whole city, and to every
individual in it·, another more noble contentiori springs from hence,
amongst all the members of the community‚ and a crown is bestowed, not
of pine, of olive, or of parssey, but one, with which is wreathed public
happiness and private liberty, the ancient rites and ceremonies, the wealth,
honour, and glory of our country, the safety of every man's property, with
every good and noble gift we wilh for from the gods: these are all inwoven
with that crown, and result from that contest, and to this all our toils and

labours lead.
A N A C H A R S Ι S.

When you had such rewards as these, my worthy friend, why did you

talk of wild olives, pines, apples, and parssey ?
S O L Ο Ν.

Even these you will not think so trifling and ineonfidmable, when you
come rightly to understand what I just now mentioned ; for these are in con·
sequence of the same plan, and should be confidered as so many small parts
of that great contention, and that noble crown which I spoke of. I have
wandered I know not how from the main subject, and got into our Isthmian,
Olympic, and Nemaean games3 but as we are now at lcisure, and you are
defirous of hearing me, we will go back, if you please, to the great prin-
ciple, that common and universal trial of skill, which, as l observed to you,
all this is intended to raise and promote,

A Ν Α C H A R S Ι S.

It would be better, l think, to do so; 1 ssiall then, perhaps, learn to
laugh no longer at those who are so happy in their crowns of olive and pars-
ley3 but, if you please, we will retire into that arbom, and seat ourselves on
the bench, where We shall be removed a little from the noise of the comba·
tants, and the shouts of the spectator53 belides, to tell you the truth, I can—
not well bear the heat of the sun, which strikes full upon my head, and 1
have left my * hat at home, on purpose that I might not appear as a fo*
