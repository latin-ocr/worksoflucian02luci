CHARIDEMUS. 567

the great Saturn3 Minerva chose the blue-eyed maid, rather than Tritoge-
nia; and Venus rejoiced, above all, in the title of ἥ golden, because it was
an' emblem of beauty.

This, whilst it shews the opinion of the gods COnCOl’ning beauty‚ is,
at the same time, an indisputable proof of its superior excellency. Pallas χ
preferred it to valour and wisdom, both of which she was the avowed pa-
troness and protector3 Juno held it in higher esteem, far above power and
empire, and called in Jove to bear testimony with her : if, therefore, there
isin beauty something so noble and so divine, that the gods themselves pay
so much attention to it, shall not we, in imitation of them, both in word
and work, value, esteem, and prote& it ?''

Thus did Philo harangue in praise of beauty3 adding, that he should have
spoken more copioussy on the subjedt, but that he knew a long oration was
ill-suited to a feast. To him succeeded Aristippus, though it was not with-
out much difficulty that he could be prevailed on, by the preffing intreaties
of Androcles, being very loth to speak, he told us, after Philo; at length,
however, he began thus:

“ It very often happens, that men, quitting those subjcfts that are noble
and useful, apply themselves, out of vain-glory, to such as can give but
little pleasure to their hearers, either -saying what has been said before, or
talking about things of no consequence or importance : lest I should myself
fall into these errors which Ι condemn, I shall make choice of that matter,
which, 1 am sure, must be agreeable to my audieuce, and which will affor-<l
me the amplest field for discuffion.

“ lf we were on any other subjeih one speech might have sufficed rs, il
lustrate it3 but beauty suggests such a variety of arguments, that no izi-,m
need be assiamed that he cannot display it to the sull; happy is he, is ire
can add something to the praises already bestowed on it ε it is, indeed, so
honoured and esteemed, both by gods and men, that those who possess it, are,
loved and valued, and those who want it, hated and despised by all, who
has eloquence enough to treat it as it ought to be treated : but if no inan,
any more than-myself, can expe& to handle such a subject according to ἑᾶς

³⁹ Golden.] Venus is always called Χρυσ ,η Αφροι οιτὲ“ m, or V enus Aurea, most probably on ao
count ofher hair: Horace too mentions his flava Chloe. Yellou. was the faihionable color ur fo
ladies locks, amongst both Greeks and Romans: poor Ki t Smart, therelQore not unfrequently
called his red· hair’ d lady “ the lass with the claffi α] hair.”
