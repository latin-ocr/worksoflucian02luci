TOXARIS. 119

Alania, and who request you to make all poffible haste to Bosphorus, lest the
empirc should devolve to Eubiotus, a bastard brother of Leucanor’s, a friend
to the Scythiam, and our avowed enemy.'' Macentes, who said this, had
greatly the resemblance of an Alanian, their arms, indeed, and language are
the same with curs, and there is only this difference, that the Scythirrns wear
longer hair, and he had taken offjust so much as would make him more like
one of them: they, therefore, gave full credit to what he had said, and he
paffed for a near relation of Mastira and Mazaea. “ And now, continued he,
Adyrmaehus, lwill either accompany you to Bosphorus, or stay herc be—
hind, and conduct the bride. As you are a relation, replied Adyrmaehus,
you had better remain, and come along with her; if you go with nie you
will only add to a number of attendants, but if you stay to accompnny her,
your presence will supply the place of many: it was accordingly thus de-
termined. Adyrmaehus set forward, leaving Mazaea, who was yet a virgin,
to the care of Macentes : he put her for that day into a carriage, but as soon
as night came on, he placed her on his own horse (having taken care to have
another to follow him), then mounted himself on the same saddle with her, ¹
and, instead of going on towards Mamas, turned afide to the Mediterranean‚
keeping* the Mitraean mountains on his right hand, and resting his beautiful
charge at proper intervals, reached Scythia With-her on the third day. His
horse, at the end of the journey, after standing a few minutes, fell down
and died. Macentes delivered Mazaea into the hands of Arsacomas3 there,¹
said he, take her, 1 have performed my promise. The lover, struck be-
yond measure with a fight so unexpeffted‚ and pouring forth his thanks in
great abundance, “ Cease‚ said Macentes, thus to treat nie as a person diffe-
rent from thyself3 to return thanks ro me for this, is as if my ³ right hand
were to thank the left for healing it when wounded, or stroaking it when in
paim how ridiculous were it to suppose that, united as our members are,
one limb performed any thing extraordinary, when it contributed to the use
and advantage ofssthe whole body ! seeing it acted for its own good, as beu

ing itself a part of that which received the benefit.''

Thus spoke Macentes to his friend Arsacomas: in the mean time
Adyrmachus, apprized of the deecit praetised on hirn, proceeded not on his
journey to Bosphorus, for Eubiotus, being called in by the Sauromatians,
