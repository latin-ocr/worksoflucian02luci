be truly ridiculous for you, who have so learnedly harangued for Pylades
and Orestes, to prove a bad orator in the defence of your own country.

It is very kind in you, Mnefippus, to give me this warning, as if your
own ‘³³‘ tongue was not injust as much danger in case 1 succeed. 1 shall begin,
however, immediately, without affeciing all that pomp of eloquence, which
you have been so lavish of, and which would but ill become a Scythiam es-
pecially where faecs will speak better than words. l shall not, like you,
extol a rnan for marrying an ugly woman without a fortune, or giving two
talents to his friend's daughter; n0, nor for going to prison of his own.

tell you of wars waged, ssaughters made, and deaths suffered for friends,
such as will make your examples look like mere trifles in comparison with

marches, as you do, nor because any one was brought up with us, or is our
neighbour: but if we see a man brave, genereus, and fit for great and noble
actions, to him we all ssy with speed, and, as you do by your women,
whom youwish to marry, court and solicit him, endeavouring, by all the
means in our power, to make ourselves worthy of his affection. The happy
chosen friends enter into a solemn oath and covenant‚ that they will live
with, and, if occasion calls, die for each other: and thus it is performed3
