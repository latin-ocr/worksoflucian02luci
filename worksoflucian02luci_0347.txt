*THEGALLICHERCULES 34¹

·f0rgot to mention one most extraordinary circumstance; this old Hercules is
represented as drawing a large number of people after him, whom he seems

to have bound by the ears with very ssender chains made of amber and gold,
like beautiful necklaces : held, notwithstanding, as they are by these weak
little links, they none of them endeavour to get away, as they might easily
do, strive with their feet, or pull against him, but press on with pleasure
and alacrity, as if fond of their 1eader, and seem to wish, be the chain ever
so loose, not to be set free3 and what is most wonderful of all is, that the
ἦ* painter, not knowing what to fix the chain to, (for he has the elul> in his
right hand, and the bow in his left,) bored a hole at the extremity of the
tongue, tied it to that, and drew them along, Hercules looking back, and
smiling at thern. I stood and admired this figure, not without some degree
of indignation; nor could 1 comprehend the meaning of it, when aGaul
standing by, a man well {killed in Grecian literature, who spoke our lan-
guage correCUy, and seemed to be, as many of his nation are, a philosopher,
thus addreffed me: “ You seem, said he, stranger, to be puzzled about this
pieture, I will explain it to you·, we do nor, like you, express eloquence by
the figure of Mercury, but by that of Hercules, as stronger and more power-
ful: do not be surprised, therefore, at our representing him as an old man,
for, in old age alone, eloquence arrives at its full strength and maturitjs, as>

saule, made them travel over the Alps and Pyrenees into Italy, from thence cross the sea into
nicily, swam with them again into Rhegium, to Illyria, from thence to Epirus, and so descended
into Greece; a pretty long jour-ney for him, and, as we see, in very good company.

ἥ Tlmpainter] It appears from this passage, that Lucian’s idea of the Gallie Hercules was
taken, not from any statue or representation oi him, but from a ρίἑῒυιές nor does he seem
to know that Hercules was worshipped by the Celts as‘the god of eloquence; but only supposeS,
that they thought fit to confides this deity as a more proper symbol of it than Mercury.
