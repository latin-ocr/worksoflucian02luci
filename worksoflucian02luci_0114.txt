108 TOXARIS.

full of wine, and holding it in his hand, receive, says he to Menecrates,
this cup of friendship from a son-in-law‚ for this day 1 mean to wed your
daughter Cydimache‚ already 1 have received the portion, which is sive and
twenty talents. Zenothemis, replied the father, this must not be, never carr
1 bear to see a beautiful youth, like thee, wedded to a girl so deformed and
disagreeable. Zenothemis, however, led her forth into the bride-charnber,v
and, after consummation, returned to Menecrates: from that time he has
lived with her, treats her with the greatest tenderness and affection, and, as-
you see, carries her every where along with him; so far is he from being,
alhamed of this match, that he seems to glory in it, shewing thus his indif-
ference with regard to the external form, whether it be beautiful or ugly,
and manifesting at the same time his contempt of riches and splendor, con·
fidering only the happiness of his friend, whom he did not esteem less wor-
thy of his affeetion from the judgment of the senate against him. For this·
integrity he hath been rewarded by Fortune, having fince had' a most beau-
tiful boy by this ugly woman, whom he bnt the other day carried into the
senate, with an olive branch round his head, and clothed in mourning, the
more to excite their pity in favour os his grand-father„ when the child smil-
ed, and clapped its hands before the senators, who, touched at the fight,
pardoned Menecrates, and he is now restored to his honours, by means os
this little advocate. Such, according> to the Maffilian's report of it, was the
behaviour of Zenothemis to his friend; an example, Ibelieve, which will
scarce be paralleled by Scythians, who, they say, always take care that their
mistreffes shall be handsome.

For my fifth and last example, Ι must not forget Demetrius of Sunium,
who travelled into AEssgypt with Antiphilus the Alopecian. They had been
brought up together from children, one applying to the Cynic philosophy
under the famous sophist of Rhodes, and the other studyingrphyfic. lt so
happened, when they were there, that Demetrius took a journey to visit the
pyramids, and the statue of ³* Memnon3 the former of these, he had heard,

ue are told, whenever the rays of the sun struck upon it, astonirhed the standers-by with
the most ravishing and harmonicus sounds, though nobody could rell how the mulie was
produced. Strabo, a most grave and respei‘lable author, gives us this account of it : “ 1 went one
day, (says he‚) with AElius Gallus, and a number of friends, to see the colossus, when we
heard a wonderful noise iffue from ir, but could not tell whether it proceeded from the statue,
the base, or from any of the persons who stood round about ir; it was impoffible to suppose that
