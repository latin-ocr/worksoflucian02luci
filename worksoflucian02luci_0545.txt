like those who live in bondage, we are deprived of them by others 3 but still
more wretched is it, when we deny them ourselves; it is downright mad*

ness and folly.. c Y N Ι Ο·

It may be so; but let me asse you onc question: if a rich man should
make a great feast, and most hospitably entertain people of all ranks, great

⁴ and small, srck and well, with every good thing, should he, at the same

time, help himself to all, not only that stood near, but that was ever so far
removed from him? should he, who was in perfect health, scize on that
which was prepared for the fick3 he, who had but one itomach to satisfy,
and which wanted but a little, and which too much would only spoil and
destroy 3 would you call such a man wife or good ?

And if another, who had been invited to this feast, should pass over the
variety of dainties on the table, and take that only dish which chanced to be
set before him, and which, alone, was sufficient to satisfy his appetite,
should he eat this homely meal in peace, without waiting for any thing else,
would not you look upon this as a much wiser and better man than the

former?

finite variety of good things, that every one may take what is fit and conve-
nient for him3 some are proper for the well, and forne for the fiel<3 some
for the weak, and· some sor the strong: it was never defigned that all should
seize on all, but that every one should take what is next to him, and what
he most stands in need of: but you, in the insatiable tage of intemperance‚
like that guest who was for snatching all, not content with what lays before
you, are perpetually wandering in search of dainties: your own land and
sea cannot suffice, but you must purchase pleasures from every corner of the
earth3 always preferring what cqrnes from abroad to what you have at
