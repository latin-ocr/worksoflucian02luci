SWANSANDAMBER. 345

could not help being angry withal, at the disappointment of my hopes, and
was vexedthat the amber should thus slip out of my hands, having already
revolved in my mind, to how many uses Ι could have put ir, and how ser-

viceable it would have been to me.
One thing, however, 1 still thought myself sure of, that I should hear a

number of swans finging on the banks of the river; and, accordingly, 1
again enquired of the sailors, (for we continued sowing up the stream 2)
“ When, said 1, will these swans give us their sweet song? they were once>
we are told, men who sung admirably, and ³· companions of Apollo, and
afterwards turned into birds on this very spot, where, not forgetful of their
mulie, they continue still to fing.'’

“ And will you never, cried they, laughing‚ cease telling fables about
our river and country ? W‘e have worked here upon the river ever linee we
were boys3 now and then, indeed, we have met with swans in the marshes,
who make a croaking noise, but so weak and inhaunonious, that our crows
and jack—daws ate firens to them: but as to the sweet songs you talk of, we
never so much as dreamed of them, and cannot help wondering where you
could pick up such stories about us.’'

Thus may people be deceived in things in this kind who trust to such as
exaggerate all they hear or speak of: I arn, therefore, not a little solicitous
with regard to myself, lest you who come now to hear me, and never heard
me before, expedsting a great quantity of swans and amber from me, should
go away disappointed, and laugh at those who promised you so many
fine things in my orations} but 1 affore you, no one ever heard me, or
· ever shall, boasting in this manner. You will find many in our Eridanus,
whose eloquence distills, not amber, but gold itself, andbwho are more har-
monicus than all the swans of the poets; but as for me, you see what I am,
plain, simple, and illiterate, nor ean Ifing at all. 'sake heed, therefore,
lest, if you expe& too much, you resemble those who look at things under
the water, suppo-ling them to be as big as by the refraetion ofthe rays they
appear from above, when they find them, on taking them out, much less,
they are violently angry. I give you xva1·n':ng‚ therefore, when the water is
poured off, andlan] taken ont, not to expe& any great matters, lest, by
your own fault, you should be disappointed.

ent manner. See Ovid's Metamorphoses», b. ii. and Virgil's AEneid, b. x.
