DEMONAX. 73

He always admired Thersites as a kind of Cynic philosopher. Being ask-
ed, which of the philosophers he liked best : ‘⁶ They are all excellent, said
he, but Socrates Ι venerate, adrnire Diogenes, and love Aristippus.⁷’

He lived till near a hundred without pain, grief, or cliforder3 without be-
ing burthensome, or under obligations to any maru was always serviceablc to
his friends, and never had an enemy. Not only 'the Athenians, but ali
Greece so loved and honoured hini, that when he appeared in public th:
nobles rose up in respeet to him, and there was an universal silence. Even
in extreme old age, he went about from house to house, supped, and lay all
night wherever he pleased3 the master always confidering himself as honour-
ed by the presence of some god, or tutelary genius. The sellers of braid,
would beg him, as he passed along, to accept some from their hands ; and
happy were they from whom he would receive it. The boys, too, would
offer him fruits, and call him· their father. On a sedition that had been
raised up nt Athens, his presence alone put an end to the tumult3 for the
moment he appeared in the affembly, they were all silent: he perccived
their shame and repentance, and without saying any thing to them, with-
drew. When he found he was no longer able to help himself, he spoke to
those who were about him in the language of the Cryer at the public games,

The laurel crown attrnfts no more,
The games are done, the sport is o'er3
Pastis the business of the day,

And we are summon’d3 hence, away !

He then voluntarily abstained from all food, and died, preserving the
greatest ease and chearfulness to his last moments. A little before his death,
somebody asking him, “ what orders he would give about his funeral :³²
⁸⁶ Never sear, said he, when Ι fiink, they will bury me.’' ‘⁶ But shall such a
man, replied his friend, be given to dogs and birds ?'¹ “ Sor much the bet-
ter, said he, for then 1 shall be of some service even after death.''

The Athenians honoured him with a magnificent funeral, and long la-
mented him. They even crowned with garlands, and held as sacred, the
stone he used to rest upon. Every body attended at his burial, and the phi-
losophers carried him to the grave on their ssioulders.

I have put together these few circumstances relating to Demonax, that
posterity may know how truly great and excellent he was,
