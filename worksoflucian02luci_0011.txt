ΤΗ FALSEPROPHET. 5

future events; for which they offered up hecatombs, and wedges of gold.

Revolving these things in their minds, and consulting together, they resolv-
ed, therefore, to set up an oracle ε this, they imagined‚ isit succeeded, would
soon make thern rich and happy3 and which, indeed, turned out cven far
beyond all their hopes. They then considered on what spot, and in what
manner they should begin their enterprize. Cocconas was of opinion, that
Chalcedon would be the fittest situation, as it was a place of great trade, ad-
joining both to Thrace and Bithynia, and withal‚ not far distant from Asia,
Gallo-Graecia, and the neighbouring nations. Alexander, on the otker
hand, preferred his own country, observing‚ (which is certainly true,') that
the first attempt in things of this kind, should always be made amongst the
most ignorant and stupid, such as the Paphlagoniam are said to be, a foolissi
and superstitous set of people, who, if a fidler‚ or a player on the tabor,
or cymbaI, comes among them, one who, as the saying is, can but prophecy
with a ³(— fieve, will run with open mouth, and gape and stare at him, as if
he were a god.

After some dispute on this point, Alexander prevailed ε and proceeding
to Chalcedon, (for they thought to find something there which would be of
service to them,) in the ancient temple of Apollo they dug up some brass
tablets, on which it was inscribed, that in a very short time AEsculapius, with
Apollo his father, would come into Pontus, and inhabit the wall of Abonus.
These tablets, contrived for the occafion, rnost effectually spread the report
through Pontus and Bithynia, and particularly about the wall of Abonus.
They immediately determined to buiId a temple there, and had laid the foun-
dation of it, when Cocconas being left behind at Chalcedon, composed

some ambiguous and perplexing oracles, and not long after died, being bit,

Ibelieve, by a viper.

. ³ Astevc.] Koskinotnancy, or divination by the fieve. Alluding probably to that passage in
the 3d. Idyl. of Theocritus, where the (hepherd speaking of a cunning woman, or fortune-teller,
sa) S, She 'tum’d the fieve, and ssieers, and told me true,

That 1 should love, and not be lov'd by you.

This kind ofdivination was generally praffised to discover thieves‚ or others suspeeted of any
crime, in this manner: they tied a thread to the fiere, by which it was upheld‚ then prayed
to the gods to diree‘t and affist them : after which, they repeated the names of the persons sus-
pec'ted, and he, at whose name the fieve whirled round, or moved, was thought to have com-

mitted the fact.
