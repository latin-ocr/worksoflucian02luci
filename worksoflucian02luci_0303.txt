ΟΝ MOURNING ton Tnz DEAD. 297

great numbers in a kind of ὅ* middle state, wander along the moad without
bodies, strades, that on the least touch, vanissi like finok‹·: these receive a
sort of nourishment from our libations, and the oll'erings which wc leave on
their graves, so that if the poor spirit has no friends or relations lest altore
ground, he stands a chance of starving in the regions below. The vulgar
are firmly persuaded, that if any ostheir kindred die, it is their dury to put
a piece of money into their mouth to pay the ferry-man for his pass'age, nor,
determining, at the same time, what coin will best pass there, whether a sar-
thing of Attica, or AEgina, οι· Macedonia will be most current; nor restet-”t-
ing, that it would be better for them not to pay at all, as the serry-man
then would not admit thern, and so they might return to life again,

vAfter this, when they have wastied thern well (as if the infernal lake was
not sufficient for the purpose), ‘they anoint with the finest ointment the al-
most stinking carcase, crown it with flowers, and dress it up fine, that it
may not catch cold upon the road, or appear naked before Cerberus. To
this succeeds the weeping of the women, tears and lamentations on every
fide, beatings of the breast, tearings of the hair, and bloody cheeks; some-
times the garments are rent in pieces, dust sprinkled on the head, and the
living, in short, in a worse condition than the dead; for they roll themselves
on the earth, and beat their heads against the ground, whilst the deceased is

finely adorned,and carried about as to some pompous celebrity ε then, perhaps,
steps forth from the middle of the croud the father or mother (sor we will
suppose, the better to carry on'the fai-ce, that the deceased is some beauti-
ful youth,) and embracing him, utters some strange and absurd speech, which
the dead man, if he had a voice, would give a proper ψ answer to; for now
the father, in a melancholy tone, eries out, ‘⁶ ζ My sweetest boy, why

would you die, and leave me thus, cut off in the flower os your age; never

ἃ Midam-stata] This is probably the
Inhumata* infletaque turba,
mentioned by Virgi13 a set of poor souls, who for want of the ceremony of being buried were
forced after death to wander about, and could gain admitte-nce neither into the regions of bliss,
nor the scats of punishment. 'The account of this in ancient authors is very imperfect and o'o-v
scure ; it seems, however, to have laid the foundation ot‘a doc'trine equally absurd with the 1³2-

gan, a Popissr purgatory.

‡ Ilsysweetcst buy, &cd This cutlom, 1 am told, is even now to be found in sever al piri>
of Irelzrnd, where the relations of the deceased, croud nbwur the grave, and cry out, ‘⁶ Ar—
rah! why would you die, my dem· homey, and leave your wife aizal street babes, &c.’'
