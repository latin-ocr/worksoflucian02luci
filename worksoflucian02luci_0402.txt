39⁶ ONLONGEVITY.

sobriety, should attain to length os days. Whole nations of men are cele⁴
brated for their Iougevity, on account of their manner of living, as the
AEgyptians, who were called sacred scribes·‚ the Affyrians and Arabians,
interpreters of mys-stenem the Indian Brachmans, deeply skilled in philoso-
phy; those who are called the Magi, prophets and holy men amongst the
Perfiaus, Parthians, Hadriam, Choramians, Sacians, Medes, with many
other Barbarians ; these were all remarkably long-lived and healthy, owing
most probably to that temperance and abstinence which their studies oblig-
’ ed them to. Even at this time there are whole nations that live much longer
than others; the Seres in particular, who are said to extend life even to
three hundred years: some attribute this longevity to the air, others to the
soil, and others to their manner of living, for they drink, it is said, nothing
but water. History tells us that the ψ Athotes also, frequently live to an
hundred and thirty, and the Chaldaeans to above 3 hundred, feeding on*
barley bre-ad, which strengthens the fight‚ and makes their senses quickef
and more powerful than those of other men.

But Ι have spoken hitherto only of those people who, we are told, lived
longer than others, either from the temperature of the air, their manner of
living, er both together3 it is necessary Ishould also add, for your future
hope and comfort, that in every climate, and in every air, men have fre-

quently enjoyed long life, by the means of proper exercise, and ufing that
diet which conduced most to health and strength.

Ι shall divide my narrative into several parts, according to the several ranks
of men, beginning with kings and leaders; happy to number amongst them
oui· own august and pious emperor, whose life is the glory and happiness of
his people ; these illustrious examples you· may yourself hope to imitate, and
by praftifing their temperanee, inherit theirlongevity. Numa Pompilius,
the most prosperous and happy of Roman kings, and who made the worship
of the gods his peculiar care, is said to have lived to fourscore and upwards3
and Servius Tullius, another king of the Romans, to the same age; and
Tarquin‚ their last soveieign, after his banishment to Cumae, enjoyed lise
in perse& health sor more than ninety years. Ι could mention many other
kings, as well as the Roman, together with several persons of inferior rank,
both at Rome and in other parts of Italy, who lived to a great age. We
