282 ANACHARSIS.

reigner amongst you3 at this time of the year, what you call the dog-star
burns up every thing, and makes the air hot and dry, and the meridian sun
just over our heads renders the heat intolerable3 1 am surprised, therefore,
that you, who are an old man, seem neither to sweat as 1 do, nor feel any

inconvenience from it, never looking about for shade, but expofing yourself

thus to the sun.

Those ridiculous labours, as you call them, Anaeharfis, our constant roll-
ing about in the nmd, and the harssiips we suffer, by being perpetually on
the sand and in the open air, are the very things which make us proof
against the darts of the sun: we want no hats to keep the rays from our.
heads; but, come, I will accompany you.

And now, observe, Ido not expe& you implicitly to obey and submit to
my laws, but whenever I appear to be wrong, that you will scrutinise and
oppose my teuets, whence this advantage will inevitably accrue, either that
you, when every thing is carefully examined, will embraee and firmly ad-
here to my opinion, or, on the other hand, Ι shall be convineed of my
error, and learn beter of you, for which the whole city of Athens will be·
infinitely obliged to you: in this case 1 {hall conceal nothing, but standing
up in the great affembly, “ Ι have given you, Ο Athenians, will I say to
them, a body of laws, which Ι deemed good and salutary, but this strange:
(pointing to you), who, though a Scythian, is a man of the highest sense
and abilities, bath convinced me of my mistake, and taught me better pre-
cepts with regard to life and manners; look upon him, therefore, as youn
friend and benefaf‘tor, and ere& a statue to him next‘ to your Minerva.'’
Athens, Ι affure you, will never be ashamed of learning what is good, even
from a stranger and Barbarian.

ANACHAR818.-
÷.÷ You Athenians‚ I see, as l have often heard, are fond ofir0ny3 for
how {houid a poor wandering she‘pherd like me, who have lived in a waggon
all my life, and strolled about from place to place, one who had never=
learned any thing before he came here, pretend to dispute about your affairs,

dog· ·days. Lucian, in the charadstr of Anacharsis, laughs at him, as well he might, for the
absurdity, but when acustom is once establissied, especi‘ally w hen founded on national vansty,
as this was, be it ever so ridiculous, it is not easily ssxaken off.
