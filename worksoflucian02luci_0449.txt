us be gone, like a parcel of fools as we are3 a sweet sight, indeed, to see
an old man roasted alive, and be choaked with the stink of him ·‚ or do you
stay here for the painter to come and take your faces, like † socrates's com-
panions in the prison ?” They began then to be very angry‚ and to abuse
me: some of them seemed ready to take up their sticks against me·, but
when I threatened to throw them into the fire after their master, they were
soon quiet.

Many were the refleetions which I made, in rny return home, on the love
of fame, a paffion not to be ffiaken off even by those who in other respeCls
are worthy of the highest admiration; even they are sensible of it as well as
this mad fellow whojumped into the fire, after having all his life deserved
it. I met several people going to the sight, and who imagined he was still
alive; for it had been given out the day before that he was to ascend the fu—
neral pile at sun-rising, which it seems is the custom of the Brachnians5
many of them therefore, when Ι told them the affair was over, turned back,
but others, who did not care so much about it, went on, to see the place,
and to get some relies out of the fire. And now, my friend, I had an infi-
nite deal of trouble, in answering the questions of all those who were inqui.
fitive after every particular. When Ι met with a senfible man, 1 told him
the plain fact, as l do y0u3 to the gaping ¹⁵ logs I added some tragic story
of my own, such, for instance, as that when the pile was lit, and Proteus
had thrown himself upon it, a great noise was heard, the earth ihook, anda
vultur was seen to rise out of the flame, and fly towards heaven, crying with
a loud voice, Ihave left earth and go to Olympus. Struck with amaze-
ment and religious horror at the relation, they enquired of me whether the
vultur flew towards the east or west; to which Ι answered whatever came up-
permost.

Going some time after into the affembly, 1 met a grey·haired old man,
whom by his beard and grave appearance one would have taken for a credit-
able witness, who, notwithstanding, after relating every thing that had hap·
pened to Proteus, told us how he had seen him after he was burned, in a
white garment, crowned with olive, walking about, and that he had left

⁸ Socrates’s companions.] Of which there was probably some celebrated pffiure: it was cea-⁴
tainly a fine subject for one.
