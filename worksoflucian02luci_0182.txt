³⁶ Cease thy tragedifing strain,
And tell me,

[οι-Ι know whom you mean ; are they engaged iu battle?
H E R M A G O R A S.
Not quite·, a little ikirmish is begun‚ they are {haking-their ssings, and
throwing outa few sarcastns on each other.

U P Ι T E R.
&Vliat can we do better, iny brother gods, than take a look at them ! let

the Hours take away the bars f1om the gnte, put the clouds on one fide, and
open the doors of heaven: O Hercules! what a croud is gathered about
thern ! Ι don’t like that-Timocles, he seems frightened out of his wits; 1 am
afraid he will spoil all, he will never lift up his head against-Danu& how-

ever, we may give him our prayers at least ι

’ξ- But pray in secret least the foe should hear.

T l M O C L E S.
ξ What dost thou say, thou sacrilegious Darnis? that there are no gods

who take care of mankind?
D A M 1 S.

D A M Ι S.

Not 1 indeed3 you must begin.

U P Ι T E R.
Thus far our friend has Jthe better of hirn3 he bawls loudest‚ and seems

ἃ Ceafi, iffa] lt is observable that these words are in verse, as well as Mercury’s ; Jupiter,
insenfibly aa it were, returns the compliment in heroics, though he defires him to leave it
off, and descend to plain prose.

ᾗ· But pray‚ {Est-J See Pope’s Homer’s Iliad, book vii. l. 23 ι.

ss What dqst, Εὕα] The gods are supposed now to be got within hearing of the dispute, and

listening to it. Timocles begins. Lucian's motione, on these occafions, are generally very
rapid, he carries us, like Horace’s tragic poet, just where he pleases,

Modo nos Thebis modo ponit Athenas.

All is animated, changeful, and entertaining.
