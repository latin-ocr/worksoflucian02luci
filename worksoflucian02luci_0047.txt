goes from thence to AEtolia, he will find Althaea, Meleager, Atalanta, th:
fatal brand, rhe combat of Hercules and Achelous, the birth of the Syrens,
the origin of the Echinae‚ when the fury of Alcmaeon had subsidcd, the story
of Nessus, and Deianira, and the funeral pile of Hercules. Thrace will
likewise produce some things very necessary to be known by him, as, the
death of Orpheus, his head swimming upon the lyre and speaking, Hoemus,
Rhodope, and the punishment of Lycurgus. Thessaly will furnish him with
still more, Pelias, jason, Alcestes, the fleet of the fifty youths, Argos, and
the ’ξ talking ship; the adventures of Lemnos, AEte, the dream of Medea,
Absyrtus torn to pieces, what befel her in her voyage, and the story of Pro·
