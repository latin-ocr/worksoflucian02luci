TnnPARASITE. 261

T Y C H I A D E S.
Is not the parasite then guilty of injustice?

S I M O.
I cannot see that; the origin and source of every other art is mean and

base, but the parafite’s is noble and generous; it springs from that boasted

virtue of philosophers, true friendship.

TYCHlADES.

Howso?
S 1 M O.

Because no body invites a rnan to dinner who is his enemy, or a stranger,
or even a person ssightly acquainted with him3 he rnust be a friend before
he can be admitted to the table, and be initiated into the rites and mysteries
of our art : it is a common saying‚ what sort of a friend must he be, who
neither eats nor drinks with us ! by which it is plain they mean, that he alone
who eats and drinks with uS, can be agood and faithful friend. That this is
the most princely, and, as it were, sovereign of all arts, is indisputable‚ be-
cause men exercise others not only with great toil and labour, but standing,
or fitting, as if they were ssaves, but the parasite praffises his lying all along
like a king. Need Ι mention here the peculial· felicity of him, who, as
Homer says, neither ³¹⁵ plants, turns the glebe‚ nor sows, but without doing
either„ feeds freely upon every thing? the orator, the worker in brass, or
the geometrician may exercise their profefiion, be they ever so fooliffi, or
ever so bad 3 but no man can be a parasite, who is either one or the other.

T Y C H 1 A D E S.
Bless us! what a fine thing it is to be a parasite ! Ι could almost wish to

be one myself instead of what l arn.
S I M O.

Ihave ssiewn already how much this excels all arts in general ; I shall now
proceed to prove how superior it is to every particular one. To compare it
with any of the vulgar and mechanic arts‚ would debase and degrade it:

we shall, therefore, only consider the most elegant and refined 3 and amongst
these, it is universally agreed, that rhetoric and philosophy are the principal
ones; which, on account of their superior excellency‚ are by many styled

ἱ· Plants.] See Homer's description of the land of the Cyclops in the 9th book of the Odysl'ey,
where he tells us the inhabitants are
Untanght to plant, to turn the glebe‚ or sow,
They all their produits to free nature owe. Pope’s Hom. Od. b. ix. l. ιη,
