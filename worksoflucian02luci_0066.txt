Neither do Ι believe that jupiter bound Saturn, sent him to Tartarus, or ·
committed any of those base actions which men attribute to him; Saturn,
we know, is at a great distance from υς, has a languid motion, and which is1

bound with chains; and the part in heaven where he resides, from its great·
depth, is called Tartarus.

There are many things in Homer and Hefiod, entirely consonant with
astrology 2 when they talk of the chain of Jupiter, and the arrows of the Suo,

All the story of Mars and Venus, is apparently drawn from thence. Ho-
mer's whole work is a conjunction of Mars and Venus; in his verses, he has
