ENCOMIUM oN DEMOSTHENES, λ

ADIALOGUE.

T his Dialogue is introduced in a very singular Manner, by a Speech which we mlst
suppose made by LchAN before fhme popular Affimbly .· it is frequently interrupted
by a Kind of Narmal-ve, and changes towards the End into a Distomse ofa vety

cumstcznces throughout, that seem to render it doubtful whether it was written by
LucrAN or κοῖς as it is, however, upon the whole, both carious and entertain-

Reader.

L Y C I N U S.

very well : it is the least you can do, in return for the instruifion and im-

THERSAGORAS.
I have begun, but not finiffied it, like a Iazy fellow as 1 am; therefore,
as 1 said before, I must walk3 but, first, let me offer up my prayers to him.
