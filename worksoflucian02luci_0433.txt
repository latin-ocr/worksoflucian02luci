off his head, took away his crown, and am made king in his stead : the Bai-
barians bow down and worship me; but [ shall rule like a Grecian, and be
called emperor. Now only confides how many cities I shall build, and call
them by my own name3 how many of those which 1 have taken by force
of arms, I shall lay waste and utterly destroy, if they do any thing

Now, Sarnippus, you may have done3 it is time for you, after such a
battle, to take a little refreshment, and celebrate your vietory with a feast at·
Babylon: befides that, your empire is a little out of ‘³⁶ bounds, and it is
