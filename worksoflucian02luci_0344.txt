333 BACCHUS.

But here, perhaps, some of my readers will cry out, ’¹' what is all this to
Bacchus? To which I must reply, that many of them (do not, by the
Graces I beseech you, conclude me mad or drunk‚ because Ι compare my-
selfto the gods), are surprised, as the Indians were at Bacchus, with my
strange and new manner of writing; when they hear my laugfflng, jesting‚
and comic sarire, they know not what 'to think of me3 some think it be*—
neath them to descend from their elephants to listen to goffip's tales, and
sseipping Satyr5‚ and will not come nigh me·‚ whilst others, finding the
ἢ· spcar under the ivy‚ are surprised‚ and afraid to return to me: but Ι can
boldly venture to affure them, that if they will come and partakc of my
feast, as my old guests used to do, they will soon learn not to despise my Sa·
tyrs and Silenus's, but drink freely, grow fond of my Bacchus, and fing
Evoe! along with me. ’

These, however, (for hearers may do what they like) are to a& as they
please; as to myself, now Iam got amongst the Indians, I will tell you an-
other tale about them, not without some reference to Bacchus, nor foreign
to my present purpose.

Amongst the Machlaeans‚ on the left of the river Indus, there is a grove,
not very large, but dark, and covered with vines and ivy, wherein are three
beautiful clear fountains‚ one dedicated to the SatyrS, the other to Pan, and·
the other to Silenus. The Indi-ans coine once every year to this grove, to
offer sacrifices, and drink water from the fountains; not all from each of
them, but according to their age; the youths from the Satyr’s, the full
grown men from Pan’s, and the old men, like me, from that of Silenus,
What the young men did after drinking, or what feats the middle age per-
formed, when inspired by Pan, it would be tedious and unneceffary to men-

* H'hat is, &cd Tragedy, or, the song of the goat, as the original name iinports, was at
first nothing but :i sacred hymn to Bacchus, sung by a chorus of men or women ς dialogue was
afterwards introduced, :ind the actor, or reader, consequendy, more attended to than the cho-
rus, whose i'ongs vvere now of a different nature, inl'omuch that the original subject of them,
the praise ofBucchus, was totally passed over and forgotten : the priests, who for a long time,
we may suppose, prelided over the whole, were alarmed at so open a contempt of the deity,
and exclnimed that, “ all this was nothing to Bacchus‚’' the complaint grew afterwards into a
kind of proverbial sayffig, to siguify any thing departing from its original intention. Lucian
applies it 'nere with archness and propriety. See the Diss'ertation prefixed to my Transsation of
Sophocles.

† Spear.] Alluding to the spears at the end of the thyrsuss'es carried by the Maenades, as
mentioned abore, in the account of the battle.
