What! that lying soothsayer‚ who deceived {Croesus and the Salamini-‡

ans, and a hundred more, with his ambiguous prophecies?
C R 1 T 1 A S.

Shall I swear 'by Neptune, then ; he who holds the three-forked scepter,
whose voice is terrible in war, who eries out as loud as »ᾗ nine or ten thou·-
sand men, he who is called the earth-makes? ⁴

T R 1 Ε Ρ Η O N.

What, that lewd deity, who debauched ’ζ Salmoneus’s daughter, who is
always committing adultery himself, and therefore patronizes and promets
all those who follow his example ? When Mars was caught in the net with
Venus, and could not get out, whilst the rest of the gods were ashamed to
intercede for him, this great equestrian, crying like a child afraid of his ⁴
master, or an old woman who wants to decoy a young girl, most grievoussy
lamented his fate, and ᾗ preffed Vulcan to forgive him, insomuch that the

lame god, at last, to please the old deity, let him go.

l-i‘ang that libidinous pimp os Jupiter, who is himself as lewd and wickedt

as his master.
C R I T I A S.

I anW‚ by what you said before of Mars and Venus, you will never admit

them: we will pass them over, therefore, and proceed' to Minerva, the
armed virgin, the terrible goddess, who wears the Gorgon’s head upon her·

snat it was not our Luci-an who wrote the philopatris, 'out his name-sake, who did it purposely
to laugh at Christianity, in compriment to Julian the Apostate. I would beg, however, to sug-
gest, that it is, to the last degree, improbable, that any writer should think of paying his court
ro such an emperor as Julian, by ridiculing that heathen mythology, and laughing‚ as he here
does, at that religion, which his master so zealoussy endeavoured to re-establish.

ἢ· Croesus] This Lucian has already taken notice of in two or three places. SeeJupiter the
Trngedian.

† Niae or ten, ξεήκ] See Hom. Il. Ε. l. 869. and Ξ. ¹48.

ᾗ( Damghan iffa] See, in Lucian’s Dialogues of the Gods, Neptune and Enipeus.

ᾗ Prcffed Vastan] Neptune laughs amuel,

Yet sues importunate to loose the god3
And free, he eries, O Vulcan, free from mame

'shy captives ; 1 ensure the penal claim.
See Pope's Homer'sOdyffey, b. viii-¹ 1. 381.
