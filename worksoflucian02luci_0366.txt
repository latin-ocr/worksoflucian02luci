if you but open your mouth, or go into the bath, nay evtn if your servants
do it, are not all your nocturnal sports quickly discovered Ρ If any of your
sools, your fidlers, or your parafites‚ should put on the lion's sszin, and walk
about with a elul), do you think he would be taken for Hercules, when
there are hundreds that can dete& hirn, that know his voice, gesture, and
habit, and have seen the washcs and paints you disguise yourselves with?
Itis ealier, as the proverb says, ro hide five elephants under your arm,
than to conceal on'e ³⁶ parasite : when it is so difficult a talk to hide the ass
under the lion's lkin, why will you attempt ro sculk behind your books? it
is indeed to no purpose; there are marks enough to berray you; you seem
not to know what above all it is necessary for you to be acquainted with,
that your reputation must depend on yonrself and your own life and man- .
ners, and not on your bookscller53 and yet you call in the evidence of At-
ticus and Callinus, who, in due time, will not fail to tuin you: and even
now, ifyou were in your senses, you would sell all your books to some man
of learning, together with your new-built house, and pay your 2 brokers
some part at least of what you owe thern.

You have two leading paffions, one for buying dear books, and the other
for purchafing young ssaves and parasite53 it is impoffible with your small
fortune to indulge them both; a little good advice in this case may be of the
utmost service to you ; let rne persuade you to quit that folly, which does
not at all become you, and apply yourself entirely to the other; instead of
ssaves and sycophants purchase, if ever so dear, freemen, who will not, like
common servants,sstell every thing that happens after your debanches, as the
hai-lot did the other day, who discovered certain iniquitous praefices, and
brought proofs and witneffes of it. Keep your money, rny good friend, for
this purpose, that you may henceforth play the fool in safety; never trust
those now about you ; for the dog that is used § to gnaw carrion will never
leave it off.

obvious.

ζ Brokers.] Greek, ανδςαποὸοκαπηλοις, a word which it is not at present very easy to ascertain the
true and exa& use of 3 the Latin interpreter transsates it mangonibus. The most natural sense,
and most agreeable to the context is that which Ι have adopted, of a broker, or faetor, a person
appointed to buy and sell, and do business for his principal-
