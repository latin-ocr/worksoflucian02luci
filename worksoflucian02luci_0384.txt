373 APOPHRAS.

ἰ can speak from my own knowlege, of what you have done in your own
country, in Palaestine and in AEgypt, in Syria and Phoenicia, in Greece and'
in Italy, and, above all, what you arc now doing at Ephesus, which crowns
all your follies.

But, first, let us have a word or two about this same Apophras; by Vc..
nus ὖ, Vulgivaga, Genetricula‚ and Cybebe, let me intreat thee to inform us
’ what there is in the term so worthy of ridicule or censure : he is no Grecian,
you are sure, but a foreigner, strayed hither out of Gaul, Scythia, or Thrace 3-
You, therefore, like a true Athenian, have entirely banished and extirpated-
him ; and 1 must be laughed at, and sent out of the country, for talking like
a barbarian : but those who know these things much better than you, say he,
is a true Athenian3 and that you could as soon convince us that Cecrops and
Erectheus were foreigners and barbariam, as prove that Apophras is not a

native and inhabitant of Attica. There are many things, indeed, which the ⁷
Athenians call by the same name as other people do; but·the term Apo—

phras‚ to express a black or unfortunate day, a day resembling you, is ’pe-
culiar to themselves. Thus have you at last, learned, as it were, by chance,
what they meant by Apophras, which always fignified with them, a day
when the magistrates would not act, when no court business was transacted, no
religious ceremonies performed, when nothing, in ss'lort, could be done with
any hopes of success, such a day was always called Apophras ; perhaps, be-
cause, on such a day, they had been overcome in battle, and, for that rea·
son, it was ever after considered as unfortunate, or ill-omen’d, on which no-
thing ssiould be attempted ; but this alone, you will say, I was ignorant of,
though Iknow every thing else : but the truth is, rny friend, to be ignorant

of any thing else that was out of the common way, might be excusable, but
this you could not posiibly call by another name, as it is the only one it ever

went bys: some things we call by their ancient and proper names, and some
vce do not, that we may not wound the ears of the vulgar, and speak a lan-
guage they do not understand. When I talked to you, for instance, 1ss10u1d
have made use of the Paphlagonian‚ Cappadociam, or Bactria-n language,
to make myself either intelligible or agreeable3 though to Grecians I would
{peak Greek. The Athenians have, at different times, made several altera-

· Venus, δὴ] Gr. Πινδκμε, και mni-umisa, και κυζηξης. Deae praefides generationis. Memo-

ratur Cybebe propter ejus 'amorem erga Attin, & quia lasciviffima fertur fuisse. To the un-

learned reader, ir is sufficient to say, that Lucian, in compliment to Timarchus, supplicatu
him in the narne ofa Drury-lane Venus.
