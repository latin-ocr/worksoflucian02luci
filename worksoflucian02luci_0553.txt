Sayest thou so? And can he send no ὺοάῒν εἰ Tartarus? Do not you re-

member, my friend, how he ³* threw down all the gods from heaven, how
he killed † Salmoneus with his thunderbolt, and to this day, il* any rebels
against him, does the same? Is* not he called the Titan-ssayer, and the
giant-killer, by old Homer ?

But hear me, good Critias: did not this same Jupiter transform himself
into a swan, and a satyr, to gratify his lust, and, moreover, into a bull also,
and, if he had not taken his mistress on his back, and ran off to sea, some
coun'tryrnam perhaps, might have laid hold on him, and this maker of
thunder and lightning had been sent to the plough, goaded and whipped.
Was it not ssiameful for an old deity, With a long heard, to go a-feasting to
ἶ AEthiopia‚ amongst men with black faces, for twelve days together, eat-
ing and toping? The affair of the ᾗ eagle and mount Ida, and his being
ΙΙ impregnated all over his body, I blulh to mention.

CRITIAS.

* ‘Threw dowm] See Homer’s Iliad, book i. 1. 591.

Of pointed lightnings, and their forky rays;
Thro’ Elis, and the Grecian towns he fleW,
Th’ audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew,
He wav'd a torch alost, and madly vain,
Sought godly worship frorn a servile train-
Arnbitious fool, with horny hoofs to pass

O’er hollow arches of resounding brass,

To rival munder, in its rapid course,

And imitate inimitable force. See Dryden's virgil, book vi. l. 788.

ζ Aithiopia] See Homer’s Iliad, book i. l. 483. This jaunt ofJupiter’s to AEthiopia seems
to have given Lucian inore offence than any of the ridiculous or cruel affions attributed to
him, as he is perpetually alluding to it.

ξ *The engle] Alluding to Jupiter’s affair with Ganymede.

ῃ Inspragnated] Thigh‚ head, διο. as before mentioned.

4 l‘Vhatstty μω] Lucian here runs through almost the whole corps of pagan denies, and treats
