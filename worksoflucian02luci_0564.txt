558 PHILOPATRIS.

“ Spcak‚ tell rne who thou att, and what thy racc,
Thy town, thy parents, and thy native place:

said they to me ; if we may judge from your habit and appearance, you seem
to be a ¹* good man.’' “ There are very few such, replied Ι, 10 be met with:
my name is Triephon, and 1 arn of the same city with yourselves.'’ They
alked me then, how things went on in the city, and in the world: “ Vety
well, said I, the pcople are happy, and will be more so.” “ That‚ cried
they, frowning most dreadfully, can never be; for the city † teems with
war and ssaughter.’' Upon this, I pretended tof.111 into their way of think-
ing: “ Yon, said Ι, who are raised above this world, who look down as it
were from a wateh-tower, on all things here below, must look into futurity :
what is doing in the air ? will the sun be eclipsed‚ and the moon perpen-
dicularly under him Ρ willss Mars behold Jupiter in a quadrant, or Saturn
oppose the Sun in his diameter? will Venus and Mercury be in conjunc-
tion, and beget more Herinaphrodires to please you? will there be violent
mins, lhowets of hail and snow, with pestilence and famine? will there be
a great quantity of thunder and lightening ?''

Upon this, they began to talk their nonsense; and, as if they were doing
some great feat, told me, that the face of things would loon be changed;
that a great ς multitude would corne to invade the city, and our armies

ι’ Agood mam] Χρης-ος. There is a doubt, :iinongst the commentatore, whether this word Km-og,
Christus, which fignifies good, does not also mean Christus. Christ, or christianus, τι ehristian.
lf the reader wishes to see this matter handled at large, l refer him 1-1 Gesner's differtation
above mentioned. This seems, indeed, to me, to be a kind ot* pun, or double meaning in the
word, and that the author meant to be witty on the occasion : if it be so, we can only say, we
arc· sorry for his misiake, especially on such a subjeci.

-j- Tame] Gr. ἓως-οκει. The word is l'rom the Frogs of Aristophanes; and as the scholiast
tells us, am ,ne-11 popa< των &vestanam a nnetaphor taken from the hard labours or miscarriages
of women. ‘1 he city has a hard ortross birth, :ind teems with nothing but missortunes.

x Will Mars, 55³0] Here we have all the nonsense ofjndicial astrology, the satne absurd and
ridiculous system which prevailed among us during a great part of the. fourteenth and fifteemh
centuries: it was certainly very fassiionable in the days of Lucian, as appears from several

parts of his wnrks. It may, perhaps, therefore, afford some comfort to the moderns‚ to refleOEt,
that the ancients were nearly as foolish as themselves in this particular

ξ Μιιίιίνιιιίυ, ζέε] Here we have a strange, obscure, and almost unintelligible account of a
set of Chrissians; for so we :ire told they were, who get together into a corner, and arnuse
th mselves, like so many modern Merhodists, with gloomy presages of universal vice, infantry,
⁷ and tuin, without, as we can find, any reason or foundation for it. Ι should rather, therefore,
bc inclined to think, that these prophets were nothing but a company of heathen assrologers,
nith perhaps two or three ignorant converts to Chriltianity mixed arnongst them, from whom
11.σ author picked up his {ew scanered :ind imperfeft notioris ofour religion.
