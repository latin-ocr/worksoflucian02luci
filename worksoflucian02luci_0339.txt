she Reader mist not expe& Wit or Humour in this little Τναὲἳ, which is nothing more
than a Panegyris· on an ingenious Architect, who had made cm excellent and well-
confirmed ΒατίαΙ 3 it is not improbable, though this is a mere Corgjefflure oj ⁷70³ own,
that Hippms, the Builder, might have complimented Lucum with the free
Usa of the Bath; and the Writer‚ in return, has immortalized him fhr it. lbr

HAVE always esteemed those philosophers most worthy ospraise and ad-

miration, who not only laid down proper rules and precepts in any art
or science, but who were, likewise, capable of exemplifying them in their
own works. The fick man who has any understanding, will call in not that
phyfician who can talk best of things that concern his profeffion, but him
whose experience has taught him the best praefice of it : he is, in my opinion,
a better mufician who can himself play and sing, than he who is only a gooal
judge of melody and song. Need I mention, that those are always esteemed
the ablest generals, who not only know how to dispose and dire& an army,
but who will themselves also stand foremost in the ranks and fight bravely:
such as, we know, in ancient times, Agamemnon and Achilles were, and
in later ages, Alexander and Pyrrhus? l do not mention this, to display
my knowlege of history, but to theur, that those who are only able to dis-
pute‚ deserve the name of sophista rather than philosopher& and that, in
all the arts‚ they are most worthy of admiration, whojoin praelice to theory,
and leave monuments of their skill and knowlege to posterity. 'snt-h, wo
are told, were Archimedes and ²³¹⁵ Sostratus the Cnidian, one of whom snb-
dued Memphis for Ptolemy, not by fiege, bnt by turning afide the course of
the river3 and the other, by an invention of his own, burned the enemies
fleet: and, before their times † Thales the Milesiam, promised Croesus,

some obscure piece of history, not mentioned by any other author, and which the commenta·
tors know not how to explain.

the river, divided the water into two currents, and consequently made it fordable. See Hero-
