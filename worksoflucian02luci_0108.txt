of the dignity of his ancestors‚ and advising him to be careful of that estate
which his father had acquired by his industry, and bequeathed to him. For
this reason Dinias no longer invited Agathocles to his feasts and entertain-
ments, but drank with the rest os the company, and fhunned him as much
as poffible. At length, this unfortunate young man was, by the sycophants
about him, drawn into an affair with one Chariclea, the wife os DemonaX‚
a man of the first quality in Ephesus, who, they made him believe, was vio·
lently in love with him. They took care she should send him letters, gar-
lands half-faded, apples bit by lnrown sweet lips, and other such tokens of
love, with which artful women allure young men. These things, they well
knew, go a great way towards drawing in the unwary, especially such as
fancy themstlres hamlsome, and easily fall into the snare. This Chariclea
was a most agreeable woman, but the true lady of measure, and always ready

pretended paffion had inveigled hundreda, when ibe perceived that she had
laid hold on this weak and unexperienced young man, would not let him
escape out of her ΞΕ talons, but held him fast, till she got the entire poffeffion
of him, destroyed herself, and involved him in a thousand calamities. She
first sent him private letters, and dispatehed her maid to him, who was to
watch ..ll his motions‚ to weep, and tell him how deeply her mistress was
enamoured with him 3 till the happy youth was thoroughly persuaded he was
the most beautiful os men, and the admiration of every wife in Ephesus.
At length, overcome by her solicitarimS, he met, and had frequent inter-
course with her, From that time, one may naturally suppose,· he was
easily and totally subdued by a beautiful and lovely woman, who well knew γ
how to charm him by herbconversation, and who, in the midst of it, would
