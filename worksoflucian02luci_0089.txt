Howisthat? LYCINUS.
POLYSTRATUS.

I mean that pietures may be very like, though not of the same fize3 as
the republic of Athens may resemble the present state of Rome, though the
latter is so much superior, because upon a larges scale.

Our third portrait 111311 1)6 taken from ‘³⁶ Theano, the Lesbian poetess‚
and Diotima. Theano 111311 lend her magnanimity, Sappho her elegance of
manners, and † Diotima‚ not only what Socrates has so commended in her,

but 1161· wisdom and prudence also. Such is our second portrait.

Auditis trul'y admirable: let us now have 3 pieture of humanity and

benevolence, that may represent 1161· sweetness of dispolition, and charity to

thepoor.
POLYSTRATUS.

For this we shall find a model in the wife of Antenor, Arete, and her
daughter Naulicae: and for her chastity and affeetion, we will take Pene-
lope, whom Homer celebrates for those virtues, or her name-sake, Pan-

thea, before mentioned.

You have now, I think, Polystratus, beautified her all over, and we
want no more portraits; for you have gone through her whole mind, and

sufficiently praised every part of it.
POLYSTRATUS.

Not so, Lycinu33 for the greatest of her virtues is still behind : her
humble and modest behaviour in that exalted station: never elated by her
good fortune, nor relying too much on human pmsperiry, 1116 is not insolent
or ridiculous, but keeps herself still on the level; is affable to all, treats 311
as her equals, without pomp, or 3116613110ος 3 concinet so much the 111016
agreeable, as it eomes from one of her rank and condition : those who thus use
their riches, not for pride'and ostentation, but for the purposes of 6113111)-
and benevolence, are worthy of the gifts which fortune bestows on them:
they alone can escape envy‚ for none grudge riches to those who enjoy them
with temperance and moderatiori: such as do not, like Homer’sss Ate,

⁸ Theano] The wife, or, as some tell 115, 1116 daughter of Pythagoras. See a full and true
account of this lady in Menege’s Catalogue of Female Philosophers.

† Diotima] See Plato’s Sympofium.
3 Ata] Injustice swift. ereo, and unconfin’d‚
Sweeps the wide earth, and tramples on mankind. See Pope'sHom.11.b.ix.1. 639.
