THEPoRTRAIT. 75

dangerous if you only see her, but if she fixes her eyes on you at the same
time, Ι know not how you can ever get away ; {he will hold you fast, and.
make you follow her about as the needle does the ἦ loadstone.

POLYSTRATUS.
Say no more about her wonderful beauty‚ but tell me who she is.

L Y C I N U S.

You think me extravagant‚ but when you see her, you will say my praise
was weak in comparison with what stre deserves. Who ibe is Ι know 1iot;
but the number of attendants, her splendid appearance, eunuc-hs, maids,
every thing, in short, about her seemed beyond what any private fortune

couldafford.
POLYST'RATUS.

Did not you hear her name?

No: all I could discover was that ssie carne from Ionia, which Ι gathered
from a person who, as she paffed by, observed to his neighbour, “ such are
your Smyrna beauties3” nor can we wonder that the finest city in Ionia should
produce the finest women: the man, Iimagine, came from thence himself,
as he seemed to be not a little proud of her.

POLYSTRATUS.

You ae‘ced like a stone indeed, never to follow her, nor ask the Smyrna
man who ssie was: but, corne, describe her form to me as well as you
can, and, perhaps, Imay recolle& her.

' L Y c 1 N U S.

You know not-what you request of me: it is not in the power of lan-
guage, at least of mine, to give you an idea of her: scarce would Apelles,
Zeuxis, Parrhaffis, Phidias, or Alcumenes be equal to the talk: art is too

weak to represent her.
' Po·LYsTRATUS.
At least tell me what her features were3 there is no danger, be they what

they will, in drawing her piihrre for a friend.
L Y C Ι Ν U S.
I think it would be safer to eall in the affistance of those eminent ardsts, '

to help me to paint her for you.

ἕ Loafflonc.] The virtues and properties of the magnet were known to the ancients ; the
great use and advantage of it was reserved to stand at the head of modern discoveries.
