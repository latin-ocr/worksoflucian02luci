442 ON THE DEATH οε PEREGRINUS.

deserves no pity. He was amended, however, by a prodigious croud, and
sucked in their applause and admiration, not confidering that a malefactor,

dragged to the gallows, is full as well attended. The Olympio games were
now over; and finer, though lhave been there four times, 1 never saw.
So many people going away together, I was left behind some time, for want
ofa carriage3 and Proteus having deferred it from time to time, at last
fixed the night when he would exhibit the spectacle, and burn himself:
rifing, therefore, at midnight, 1 was carried by one of my friends to Har-
pina, where the funeral pile was prepared, about twenty stadia frorn Olym·
pia, near the Hippodrome, on the east fide: it was raised in a ditch five

foot deep3 a number of torches were spread about with buffies, that it
might take fire the more eafily.

The moon rifing, (for {he was to be a witness of this noble deed,) the vic-
tim came in the habit which he commonly wore, and with him some of the

principal Cynics 3 amongst whom was the great Theagenes, with a torch in
his hand, to play the second part; and no bad performer‘: Proteus likewise
carried a torch : they entered from oppofite fides, and lit the pile with the
torches and saggots; then the hero (Ι beg you will attend to rne carefully)
laid down his bag, his cloak, and his Herculean club, and appeared in his
ssiirt, and a very dirty one it was: he then asked for some frankincense,
which, being handed to him, he threw in, and turning to the south, (this
turning to the south is a principa} circumstance in the tragedy,) “ Ye
paterna} and maternal shades (he cried) accept me :” and saying this, he
leaped into the fire, and the flames rifing on every fide, Ι saw ¹* no more of
him.

I see you, methinks, my dear Cronius, laughing heartily at the catastrophe
of the drama: the calling on his mother’s shade Ι have no objection τος
but, when 1 heard him invoking his father's also, and recolleEted what had
been said about the murther‚ Ι could not help smiling. The Cynics did not
ssied tears‚ but stood in mournful filence round the pile, with their eyes fixed
on the flame ι the sight of this provoked rne to cry out, “ For ibatne, let

¹* No more ofhim.] lt is not improbable, that this arch-impostor, for such he undoubtedly
was, might, after all, escape by some secret paffage under-ground, which he had prepared on

the occafion3 as we cannot otherwise well account for a scoundrel, like Peregrinus, carrying
the jest so far.
