ENCOMIUM ors DEMOSTHENEs. 517

always wrote them when he was in liquor, as if the wine· had sharpened his
wit, and inspired him: but not so Demosthenes, who drank nothing but
water; which made Demades say, others spoke by the 3 water, but he
wrote by it: and so neat and. tei-se were his orations, that Pytheas said they

smelt of the lamp.

Thus far we go hand in hand, and Ι can say nearly the same with regard
to the poetry of Homer : but when we come to confidet his goodncss and
humanity, his fair and honest management of the public money, his zeal

Do you mean to go on, and drown me with his praises?
THERSAGORAS.

Ido: to mention his public feasts, and sports, his manning the fleets,
building fortifications, freeing captives, marrying virgins for the good of
the state, sending ambaffies, and ena&ing salutary laws3 when 1 think, in
short, how much he did to serve his country in every respeffit, Icannot
help smiling, to see my friend contracting his bmw, and afraid that he
should not find matter sufficient for an encomium on Demosthenes.

Can you imagine that I, who have been so long engaged in the study of

oratory‚ should be a sti-anger to the merit and affions of Demosthenes?
THERSAGORAS.

I should think ΓΟ, if you really wanted, as you say you do, any affist-
auce for such a talk: but, perhaps, he throws such a splendour round, that
you cannot look at so dazzling an object: the same, indeed, happened to
me with regard to Homer3 I was very near throwing my work afide, be-
’ cause Icould not keep my eyes fixed upon it: Ihave however, 1 know not
how, recovered, and accustomed myself by degrees to look up at the sun,
that Ι might not appear totally ignorant and unworthy of such a subjectg
your’s, notwithstanding, is certainly a much eafier undertaking: for all
the praises of Homer must center in his poetry alone, whilst the virtues of

Demosthenes are only too numerous, like the luxuries of a Siciliain table,
or a grand and magnificent spectacle, where all the senses are delightcd‚ and
