had been 11111611 by 3 mad dog; if I do not apply a remedy immediately,
the very remembrance of it will make an end of me; say no more, there-
fore about it, but begin a prayer from the father, and en'd with the

’ἒ doxolo .
But 11111ςέ1 have we here ? is not that Cleolaus stridjng this way in such α’

hurry? Shall we call him to us?

It must be he : by 311 meam. What, ho 3 Cleolaus;

2}- Stop, gentle manger, pass not by, but come

'What is the matter that you are in such haste ? you seem quite out of
bseath: are there any particular news?

CLE01LAUS.

Great Susan the fam'd city soon 111311 fall,

tbi: puffige is quoted.

† xmp, δα] As this is in verse in the original, it is probably quoted from some tragic
writer not now extant.

ζ At length, iffa] More iambics in the original, but whether quoted from any ancient
writer, or 11111116 purposely by the author, we know not ς the annotators are extremely puzzled
about the liic'ts here alluded tc, which, 1 believe, will never be ascertained. 1 111311, however,
take the first opportunity of wriring a large treatise on this subject 3 wherein 1 propose to fix the
611361 time when this dialogue was written, and to prove by whom, with 311 exa& account of
311 the wars, fiege5‚ &c. that happened for some hundred years before and aster Lucian’s time,
which will settle this important affair.

But this 13111 1 shall not perform, till 1 have—nothing else to do.

ξ That God, ἰδ’ c] More iambics, but heaven knows from whom.
