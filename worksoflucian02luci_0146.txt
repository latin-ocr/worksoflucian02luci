way, said he, my dear, that Ι could poflibly escape whipping3 it {hall bc
done immediately :'' such was the result of the conversation between the cook
and his wife.

Perceiving, therefore, what 1 had to expect, Ι thought it best to avoid,
ifpoffib1e‚ the death which threatened me, and breaking the halter with
which I was f2‚1stened Ι ran sszipping and prancing into the room where they
were all at supper together, and threw down the candles, table, and every
thing that came in my na) this I thought an excellent contrivance, ima-
gining that the master of the farm would have immediately ordered me to
be confined, and taken care of as a mad ass; but this trick of mine had like
to have eost me dear; for, thinking I was mad, they all ran upon me with
swords, spems, and staves, as if they intended to make an end of me τ
aware of the very great danger I was in, Ι ran away towards the chamber

last, near the waist os our divinity: they then carried back the thieves, and
bound thern, took our goddess off m) back, placed her m another temple,

and gave the goldcn cup back to their own.

The next day it was resolved that Ι, with the rest of the goods‚ should be
disposed of; and they sold me to a millet that lived in a neighbouring vil-
lage, who took me home, through a very rough road, with ten mea-
snres of wheat on my back. When Ι came there, Ι found a number of fel-
