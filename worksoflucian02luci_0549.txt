yourselves, never ael: according to reason and judgment, but merely from
faihion and caprice. You are like men borne away by a torrent; as they ·
rush on wherever the tide carries them, so do you, wherever your paffions
lead you : it happens to you as to ³* one who mounted a vicious and unruly
horse, who ran away with him; when he was asked by a friend who met
him on the road, whither he was going in such a hurry, his answer was,
'wherever he (pointing to his horse) thinks proper z and yon, in like man—
ner, if any one should assc. you where-,you are going, if you answer candidly,
must say, wherever our defires lead us. Some may say, where pleasure3
some, where glory3 some, where avarice shall direct. Sometimes anger,
sometimes sear, and sometimes other paffions carry you away with them ;
for you mount and are run away with, not by one, but by many horses‚ all
of them vicious and unruly, who throw you into ditches, and down preci-
pices; nor before the thing is done, do you know at all what you are go-
ing to do. In the mean time, this tattered garment, and long hair, which
you hold in such derifion ; this manner of life which you despise, enables
me to spend my time in ease and happiness ; to do what Ι please, and
converse with those whom I like best. My appearance keeps at a distance
from me the fooliih and illiterate : the delicate and refined are sure to shun
me, whilst the good-natured, the just, and virtuous, crowd around me:
these Ι receive with joy, for these I love to affociate with ι the doors of
those whom you call men, I never enter; golden crowns and purple I look
upon as empty smoke, and despise the owners of them. With regard to
my habit and appearance, which you laugh at, I would have you know,
it is hemming, not only the best of men, but even the gods also : observe
their statues, which do they resemble most, me or you ? look into the tem·
ples both of Greeks and Barbarians, and mark whether the gods have long
beards and hair like me, or are fflaved and painted like yourselves. You
will find most of thern without ψ waistcoats asI am. How dare you, there-
fore, speak of my habit as contemptible, when you see the gods themselves

wear it, as the most decent and becoming?

ο T„ one ζόῃ] From this story might probably arise the common saying, that “ every man han
his hobby-horle,’' of which much use has been made by many a facetious writer.

{- lVasscoats.] Gr. αχιτωνως, the under-habit or waistcoat, both of men and women, amongst
the Grecians, was called Χιτωι.
