When the famous Herod seemed beyond measure afflieted at the untimely
death of his dear son Pollux, and had ordered his charior and horses to be
got ready, and a supper prepared for him; he came to him, and said, “ I
have got a letter for you from Pollux.” Herod giving in'o the deceit, cried,
and what does he want of me ?'’ ‘⁴ He is very angry, replied Demonax, that
you do not come to him.'' The same Herod weeping bitterly for the 10ss of
his son, and ssiutting himself up in darkness; he carne to him, and told hini
‘⁷‘ He was a magician, and could raise up the ssiade of his son, on condition that-
he produced three men who had never grie-ved for any thing.'' Herod begin·
ning to doubt and hesitate, for in truth he could find out no such person;
‘⁴ How ridiculous, then, is it inv you, said Demonax, to imagine yourself the
only ¹unhappy man, when you cannot find one who hath not tasted of misfor-
tune !’' He used to laugh much at those, who, in their conversation affected
uncouth and antiquated phrases3 one of these being remarkably absurd, he
said to him, “ I asse you a plain question in intelligible terms, and you an-
swer me in the language of Agamemnon.’' One of his companions saying to
him, “ Let us go to the temple ofAEsculapius, and pray to him for the health
of my son ;'' “ Dost thou suppose, said Demonax, that AEsculapius is deaf,
that he cannot hear us pray just as well from hence.’' One day hearing two
ignorant philosophers in dispute, one asking foolish questions, and the other
returning answers nothing to the purpose, “ ³* One os these, says he, seems to
be milking a he-goat, whilst the other holds the fieve under hirn.” Agatho-
cles the Peripatetic, boasting that he was the first and only logician, “ If you
are the first, said he, you cannot be the only one; and if you are the only
one, you cannot be the first.’' WVhen CetheguS, a man of consular dignity‚
was sent from Greece into Asia to represent his father, he said and did a num-
ber of ridiculous things, and one os his companions observed, “ that he was
a wondrous great fool.‘' “ Fool enough, said Demonax, but there is no great
wonder in it.'² When Apollonius the philosopher went off with several os

his scholars to attend on, and instruet the emperor, ‘⁶ There goes ἢν Apollonius,
