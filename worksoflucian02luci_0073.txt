DEMONAX. 67

’κ Favorinus being informed by some body that Demonax had laughed at
his discourseS, particularly those that were mixed with foolish verses, and
said that they were poor, womanish‚ and unbecoming a philosopher,
carne to him and asked what fellow that was who had darcd to ridicule his
performances: “ A man, replied he, who has ears that are not to be imposed
on :” the Sophist still preffing on him, asked “ How it happened that from
a child he was a philosopher ?” ⁴to which he answered, “ Only because from
a childl became a man.'’ The same Sophist asked him another time, “ what
se& of philosophers he belonged to :'’ “ How do you knOW‚ said he, that Ι
am a philosopher ?‘' and then laughed to himself, when the other enquiring
what he smiled at, “ I smile, says he, to think how you can pretend to
judge of a philosopher by his beard, when you have none of *j* your own.
A Sophist of Sidonia used to praise himself violently, and boast that he was
acquainted with every part of philosophy (but I will give you his own words),
“ lf Aristode, said he, should summon me to the Lyceum, Ι would follow
him thither3 if Plato to the Academy, I would meet him there; if Zeno
to the Portico, Ι would attend him; if Pythagoras commands me, Ι will
be filent.'' “ Harl< you, said Demonax, rising up in the middle of the au-
dience‚ and calling him by his name, ἶ Pythagoras calls upon you.'’

A Macedonian youth, mighty handsome, and well-dressed, who had a
mind to play the fool with him, asked him a sophistical question, and des«
fired he would finish the syllogism: “ One thingl know, child, said he, that
you are §finished yoursels l'’ The boy, angry at thejest, and threatening him,
cried out, “ I will shew you a man presently.'' “ I did not know, replied

most of the bon mors handed down to us, there seems to be a stiffness‚ and want of that ease and
politeness, which we frequently meet with in modern times. 1 am inclined, indeed, to
believe that conversation is one of the few things in which we excel the ancients5 and Ι have„
myself, heard more bon mots, when in company with Foote, Gari-ick, Warron, Goldliniih,
Burke, &c. in one day, than would have served Lucian’s friend, Demonax, fora twelve-
mouth.

ξ Finished.] Greek, πεςαηεσθω, unum inquit, puer, novi, says the Latin translaiiom σε
πιςαινεσθόιι, περαινειν, (says the commentator on this passage) est dialefficum, significatque efficere,
vel concludere aliquid ex sumptis quibusdam. The Latin transsator, we see, could not find a word
in his tongue which would properly explain the ambiguous Greek one.-—But ours, which hears
more analogy to the original, is a tolerable substitute, and expresses the meaning pretty exaCtly.
