the AEthiopians to the Day3 the Cyllenians to Phanes ; the Assyrians to a
Dove3 the Perfians to Fire; the AEgyptians to Water, which is universally
adored by them ; the Memphians worship an Ox; the Pelusiots an Onion3 to
some the Ἐ Ibis is a god, to others a Crocodile, a ἡ· Cynocephalus, a Car, or
an Ape3 a Right Shoulder is carried by some through the strects as a deity,
