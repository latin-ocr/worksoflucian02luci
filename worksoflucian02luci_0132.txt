me without ccremony : you sce, Lucius, 1 have bur a small house, it is big
enough, however, to entertain a guest, and your company, if you can put
up with it, will make it a great one. He then, calling the maid, “ Go, said
he, ssiew my friend his bed-chamber, put his things into it, and then con-
du& him to the bath; sor he comes a great way, and must be fatigued.'’
Palaestra, upon this, immediately shewed me to my room : “ You, said she,
must sseep in this bed, 1 shall make up a conch sor your boy close to you,
and will get him a pillow :'' saying this, she led us to the bath, where we
washed ourselves, and gave her some money to get provender for our horses.
We then went back into the house, where Hipparchuffi embracing me, de-
fired me to fit down by him : the supper was by no means a scanty one, and
the wine sweet and very old : after supper we drank and chatted, and spending
the evening in a chearful and hospitable manner, went to bed. The next
day he asked me to what place I was going, and whether I meant to con·
tinue there. I told him Ι was on my journey to Lariffa, where I proposed
to stay four or five days: this, however, was only a pretence, for Ι meant to
remain where I was, in hopes of meeting some woman skilled in the magic art,
or seeing a man fly, or turned into stone, or, in short, some misaele or other of
that kind: with this view I traversed the city, not knowing zrt the same time
how or where to enquire about it. I rambled round, notwithstanding, and,
as Ι was going along, Iobserved a woman, young, and, as Ι imagined, of
good rank and condition, being well dressed, and with several servants after
her. She came up to, and saluted me: Ι returned the civility ι she then
addrefl'ed herself to me, “ My name, said she, is Abraea, a particular friend
of your mother's, I love her children as dearly as my own; why, my son,
would not you come and live with me ?’' ‘⁶ That, replied I, Istrould be glad
to do, but know not how I can leave my friend, whom I have no reason to
complain οἷς my heart, however, shall be with you, though I cannot.’' “ And
where do you lodge?'’ said she. “ With Hipparchus, said 1.” “What, with that
miser !'’ “ Call him not so, Ibeg you, said I, my good mother, for to me he
has behaved nobly‚ and with the greatest generofity, insomuch that I have
more reason to blame him for extravagance.'' She smiled, and laying hold of
my hand, “ Beware, said she, of the wife oinpparchus3 she is agreat magi-
cian, and withal casts a wvanton eye on every young man that comes in her
way : if he does not behave as she would th, she makes use of her art *to
revenge herself on him} she has turned some into beasts, and entirely made
