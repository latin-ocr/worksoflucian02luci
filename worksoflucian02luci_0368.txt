no use of them, and still be laughed at by men of letters, who value them
not for their external beauty, or for what they eost, but for the merit and
genius of the writer. And yet, you think, that your ignorance must be
concealed‚ and that men will have a high opinion of you, from the multi·
plicity of your books3 not perceiving‚ that in this you resemble those un-
sszilful phyficians, who have fine ivory chests for their medicines, * cupping
instruments made of filrer, and launcets tipped with gold, though they do
not know how to make use of them3 whilst an understanding man, with a
rusty case of instruximus, {hall take out a ssiarp launcet, and cure the patient
immediately. Or rather, to suit you better with a more ridiculous compari-
son, obser-ve the barbers, and you will perceive that the best artists among
them have a common razor, and a moderate fized looking-glass; whilst the
bunglers‚ aud those who know but little of their trade, produce a multitude
of instruments, and immense specula, though these are generally ignorant of
their bufiness; and yet it is the custom, which is foolissi enough, for peo-
ple to go to the one to be ssmved, and to the other with the large glaffes, to
have their hair done. In like manner, you might lend your books to others,
though you do not know how to make use of thern yourself: but even this
you will never do, for you are like the dog in the manger, neither eat your·
self, nor let the horse do ir. -

Thus far I have given you my opinion with regard to your books only;
your life and conversation shall be reserved for another opportunity.

ancients, was generally of brass or horn ; the moderns make much better of glasS.
