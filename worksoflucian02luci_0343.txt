BACCHUS. 337

looking fierce and angry, a pipe in one hand, and a crook in the other,
frisking, and playing about through the army, and frightening the women,
who, as> he approached towards them, let their hair hang loose and distre-vel—
led, and cried out Evoe 3 by which the Indians supposed-they meant to call
their master: the flocks, however, of the natives were seized by the
women, torn in pieces, and eat by thern, for th'ey devoured raw ssessx.
&Vhen the king and people of that country heard all this, they laughcd at
thern, and, as we may naturally suppose, did not think it worth their while
to prepare an army, or make head against such an enemy3 women they
thought would be the most proper to repel their attacks, as it would be un-
becoming rnen to fall upon and kill a parcel of mad females, and an effemi-
nate leader with his hair tied up, or a little drunken old fellow, or the other
half-soldier, with a croud of naked dancers, all objeets of contempt and ri-
dicule: but when at length the news was brought that the god had laid their
country waste, burned their cities, set fire to their woods, and laid almost all
India in flames (for '‘²¹‘' fire you must know is Bacchus's weapon, and part of
his father’s lightning), they immediately took up arim, bridled and fur-
nished their elephants, put towers upon them, and prepared for the attack,
still holding them in contempt; but resolved with all poffible speed to make
an end of this beardless leader and his army. When they came in fight of
thern, the Indians placed their elephants in the front, and began the onset.
Bacchus, on his part, took his post in the middle, Silenus commanded the
right wing, and Pan the left, and the ‘Satyrs were appointed leaders of the
inferior ranks, and the word was Evoe 1 The drums beat, and the cymbala
gave the fignal of attack, a Satyr founded the alarm, Silenus's ass brayed
most martially, the Maenades affrighted them with their howlings, and shew-
ed the spears at the end of their thyrsuffes, which were wreathed with ser-
pents: the Indians and their elephants immediately gave way, and in the
utmost confufion turned their backs and fied, not venturing to come within
reach of a dart, till at length they were all totally routed and taken prisoners,
by those whom they had thus despised, and learned hy experience‚ that
foreign armies are not to be held in derifion, merely from the first report
that is made of them.

³ Fire, &eq Bacchus, we are to remember, was the son of jupiter and the unfortunate
Semele, who fell a sacrifice (as many other ladies have done), to her ambition ; and Bacchus,
as Lucian humoroussy hints, inherits part of the fire that killed his mother.
