368 OnCALUMNY.

pains that nothing improbable, or foreign to the purpose, shall appear in
their accusations3 for which reason they generally produce, against him
whom they calumniare, such crimes as he might most probably be guilty οἷς
accuse the phyfician, for instance, as a poisoner, the minister as a traitor‚
the rich man as a tyrant; add to this, that the paffions of the hearer genc-
rally furnish matter for, and point out the subjeet of accusation to the ca-
lumniator. lf the great man is jealous, such a one, they tell him, winked
at, or made figns to his wife3 or when hc looked at her, he sighed‚ ssie in
return looked kindly at him, with a smile of love and complacency, with
other marks of loose and adulterous defigns. If he values himself on ha's
talents for poetry, by heaven, says somebody, Philoxenus laughed at your
verses, abused them, and swore they were rough and inharmonious. If he
is ²³4 pious and religious, his friend shall be represented to him as a profane
follow, or an atheist, one who disbelieves a divine providence, and denies
⁵ the being of a god. In all these cases, the man can hear but one fide ; he
grows angry and enraged at his friend, and at once hates and abhors him,
without waiting for reasons or proofs against him,· as they always produce
such things as they are sure will most incense and provoke the person to whom
they are told ς when they know which part is most eafily wounded, to that
they dire& the blow, and in such a manner, that enflamed with immediate
resentment, no room is left for an enquiry after truth3 so that if a man is
willing to defend himself, he shall not be permitted, the judgrnent being al·
ready predetermined by an appearance oftruth.

But the most successful species of calumny is that which accuses a man of
doing what is most opposite to the taste and inclination of the hearer. Thus
Demetrius, the Platonist‚ was accused before Ptolemy ·†· Dionysus, for
drinking water, and appearing without a female garment at the feast of Bac-
chus3 and if he had not, the very next day, before a number of people,
drank wine, put on a Tarentine habit, and danced to the cymbals‚ he would
probably have been put to death, as a man who would not conform to the
luxurious manner of living praetised and prescribed by the emperor.
