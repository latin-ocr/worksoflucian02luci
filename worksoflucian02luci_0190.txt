a parricide, perhaps, abuffoon, or a pathic, hold the best places in the ffiip,
whilst the honestest fellows in the crew shall be crouded into a corner, and
trod upon by the most worthless and abandoned. Remember how Socrates,
and Phocion, and Aristides lived, when they were on board, with scarce
bread to eat, or room in their hammocks to stretch their legs in ; and, on
the other hand, what a full fail of ease and luxury did Ψ Callias and Midias,
and Sardanapalus enjoy, spitting down upon all those that were beneath
them. Such, my most wisc and noble Timocles, is your boasted veffe1;
not to mention the thousand wrecks it meets with: if there were, indeed, a
sszilful pilot at the belm, who overlooked and ordered every thing, surely he
would not *be ignorant which were good failors and which were bad ones, he
would allot to every one that office which he was fitted for, and give the
best to the best, and the worst to the worst men; would choose his counsellors
and companium from amongst the good and worthy3 take care that ‚every
part of the veffel was well attended to; and whip the lazy fellows for neg-
leffing their duty. Iam afraid, my friend, this veffel of your’s will not
hold water, at least, under so bad a commander.

I think so too; ‘but this, Timocles, says nothing to the purpose, brings
no strong proofs 'to support ,our cause, nothing but the common fiimsy stuff

that is easily resumet.

Since my fhip is not stout enough for you, Darnis, I will even throw out
the -l- sacred anochor, as they say, which no force can tear up.

³⁶ Callias, ἔξω] Α famous liberrime, satirized by the comic poet Cratinus, for debauching the
wifeof Phorus or Phoryon, and buying offthe indictment against him for three talents. Midias
is censured by Plato and others, as a wicked fellow, and an embezzler of the public money en.
trusted to him. sardanapalus was a king of Assyria, remarkable for his vices, diffipation, and
effeminacy‚ which ended in the destruction of himself, and the tuin of his empire.

† Fullsail] Momus, to carry on the allusion, speaks in the sailor's style, and concludes the
allegory‚ which is carried on throughout with the greatest degree of humour and propriety.

ss Sacrcd anchon] lacere sacram ancoram, to throw out the sacred anchor, was a proverbial
expression, fignifying‚ to make thelast effort.
