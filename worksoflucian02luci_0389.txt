APOPHRAS. 383

In Syria you were called Rhodo-Daphne, or the Laurel-Rose; for what
reason, (so Pallas help mel) Iblush to menti0n; in silence, therefore, for
me, let it ever remain: in Palaestine you went by the name of the Briar, on
account, I suppose, of the bristles in your beard3 for then you used to
ssiave: in AEgypt they called you Qinsey, and properly enough, sor you
were very near being choaked by the sailor who set upon you. The Athe.
nians, indeed, went no round about way to describe you, but only added
one letter to your name, and called you *- A-Timarchus; you deserved,
indeed, some little addition to· that title. In Italy you acquired the heroic
appellation of a Cyclops, when you acted over again Homer's fabulous his*
tory, and lay, like anotherlustful Polypheme, with the cup in your hancl;
whilst a youth, hired for the oceafion, carrying· a pointed spear, played
Ulyffes, and struck at your eye, ·

⁹}- Thejav’lin err‘d, but held its course along,

Soon it

‡ Crash'd all his jaws, and left the> tongue within,
Till the bright point look’d out beneath the chin.

You, Cyclops like, suffered him to wound your cheek; or, like another
Charybdis, looked ns if you could have swallowed him up, veffel, sails,
mariners, and all together (when one is talking of you, one must rant a
little) 2 numbers of people saw you in this condition,· and after all, in excuse
:for your frolic, you said next day you were drunk, and made the wine your
apology for it.

With so many, and such great names as these belonging to you, why
should you be assiamed of Apophras only? How feel you, when even the
common people say you have got the ᾗ Lesbian and Plioenician disorder?
But, perhapS, you are ignorant of this too, or imagine that they mean to
pay you a compliment by ir, or are these well known and familiar to you,

and Apophras alone blotted out of your catalogue? I am sufficiently'reveng·

‘Y‘ A—Yi'marchus] His name was Thnarchus, and they called him A-Tiinarchus, quali,
Ατιμων Αξχος, the Prince of Ruscals, a kind of pun in the original. The addition, which Lu-
cian says he wanted, was the ων. As puris are untranssnteilble, the mere English reader cannot

well see the humour of this title.

ἡ· ‘Thejav'lfn‚ ἐξίῃ] See Honier's Iliad, Λ. 233.

ss Crafh’a', ἐξω] See Homer's Iliad, book v. 1. 354·

ξ mbram] The Lesbians and Phoenicians were remarkably guiltyofa certain horrid and un-
natural crime, which the Greeks very properly styled αξξητον μιξιν, a conueftlon not fit to be
mentioned, and yet it was uniret·s.111y praclised. d
