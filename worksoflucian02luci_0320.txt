Know you any in whom this love of falsehood is so strongly implanted?

TYCHIADES.-
Many. PH1LocLEs.

What can we say for such, but that they are fools and madmem who
thus prefer the worst and meanest‚ to the noblest and best of things!

TYCHIADES.

And yet it is not always so; for many have Ι known in other respects men
of admirable sense and wisdom, who yet have, Ι know not how, been so in—
fatuated with this vice, as to be ever deceiving others, and themselves als0;

you know as well as l do, how egregioussy those ancient writers ‘²⁶ Herodotus
and † Ctefias, and before them the famous poets‚ with Homer himself
amongst them, by their lies, imposed upon not only the readers of their
times, but delivered thern down in their beautiful verses even to our own.
Ι blush for them when they talk about the ’,ζ divifion of heaven, the chains of

³⁴¹ Herodotus] ln this writer, who is certainly one of the most agreeable liars of antiquity;
we meet, as Lucian here intimares, with some very strange stories. Herodotus, however, it

but gives us the lie just as he found it, leaving his readers to allow it what degree of credit they
think proper.
