A most tragical story indeed, Toxaris, and bordei-ing on the 1311010115.
The wind and sword you surore by, will pardon me, isI really think those
not much to blame, who should not believe it.

I wish, my noble friend, your credulity does not procecd from envy. Your
want of faith, however, 111311 1101 prevent my producing some more 36110115
of the same kind, which Ι know 10 have been done by Scythians.

I beseech you then, my good man, not to be 16111005, and long—xvinded'
in your discourse, that you would not carry me up and down from Scythia to
Machlyia, to Bosphorus, and back again, to wear out my patience.

You are the legissator, and must be obey’d in every thing, Ι 111311, therc-
fore, be as short as poffible in what Ι say, and not tire your ears with my
travels for the future.

You shall hear what a friend did for me, whose name is Sifinne52 &thn
in search of Grecian literature, Ι left my own country to go to Athens, 1
went by sea to Amastris, this city being in my way, and conveniently fituated
for those who corne from Scythia, and not far from Carambis. Sisinnes,
ε who had been my companion from a child, accompanied me thither. We
immediately looked out for a lodging near the 113111011τῶ and removing our
bundles to it out of the ship, withoutsuspecting any 0111611161,16111116111111616,
and went to the [namet-place. In the mean time, some thieves broke open
our trunks, and stole out every thing we had, not leaving so much as would
serve ns even for one day. WVhen we came back, and heard what had hap-
pened, we knew not what to do; publicly to accuse the neighbours, who
’ were very numerous, or the master of the house, we did not think advise-
able: to give it out that we were robbed of fourscore Dariuffes, a quantity
of eloaths, bedding, and other things, would only have made us appear to
the populace 35 6116315 and impostors. Thus stripped of every thing in a
strange country, we were much 31 a loss how to 3611 for my own part, I
was rather for making 311 end of our-selves 31 01166, than submitting to any
