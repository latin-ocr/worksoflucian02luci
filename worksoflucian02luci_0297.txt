ANACHARSIS. 291

SOLON.

If you stay a little longer with us, you will soon see it; ive have erens,
horses, trappings, and arms of every kind to use, whenevcr there is oc-
cafion for them: a fourth part of our citizens are horsemen; bur we think
it very unneceffary to wear arms in time of peace; it is even forbidden by
our laws to carry them about the city: but it is pardonable, indeed, in you,
who are always at war ; as you live without any walls and bulwarks, you arc
perpetually exposed to treachery, and for ever in danger, a man may drag
you by night out of your cart, and kill you in your sseep; you live in sear
of each other, every man ae‘cs as he pleases, and there are no laws to restrain
you: the sword‚ therefore, must always be drawn, and ready to defend you
against violence and rapine.

You think it then unneceffary to carry arms constanrly about you, but
lay thern by you for service when there may be occasion for them, subduing
the bodies of your young men by perpetual labour, and exhausting all their
strength by rolling in dirt and filth for nothing.

S O L O N.

You seem to confider the strength of man as if it was like water, wine, or
any other liquor, that by dint of labour it would evaporare out of the veffel,
and leave the body dry and empty, having no resource to supply it with
more; but this is not the case, for the more strength is exhausted by exer-
eise, the more is added ; like the hydra, which ·when one head was cut off,
produced twoin the roorn of it; but if they are not inured to labour from
their infancy, and by that gain supplies of strength, then are they quickly

.c0nsumed and worn away by the least toil or exertion; it is like fire and a
candle, the same breath which adds force to the one, extinguishes the other,
if you do not supply it with fresh matter.

A Ν Α C H A R S 1 S.

1 really do not understand you; your allufions are too refined, and above
my comprehenfion: but I should be glad to know why at the Olympio,
Isthmian, and Pythian games, when so many people, as you tell me, come
together to see your exercises, you do not arm your young men, but send
them forth naked, to be kicked and beat about, and when they conqner

give them nothing but apples and olive garlands.
