CHRoNosoLoN. 469

Let every one joke and *rally as much as he pleases, provided that he does
it with decency, and hurts nobody. Ἴ

Above all, let nobody play at dice for any thing but nuts: if any man
plays for him, let him have no vid'tuals the next day.

Let every man stay as long as he pleases, and go away when he likes.

1f the master invites ssaves to the feast, both he and his friends shall wait
upon them.

Let every rich man take care that these laws be inscribed on a brazen co-
lumn in the middle of his hall ; there to be read by every one.

And be it known, that,
as long as this column remaineth, never shall famine, pestilence, fire, or
any evil thing, come upon that house3 but if ever, which heaven avert'.
it should be destroyed, wo be to them! it is not our fault,
