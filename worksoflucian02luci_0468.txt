452 SATURNALIA.

In good truth‚ Sarum, Idid not ask this of my own head. Hefiod and

Homer taught it me; not to mention, that three parts of the world beside

fully believe it.

And how do you think that rustic, bragging impostor should know any
thing of me? Only reste& a little: is it poffible that a man, much less a
god, should ever devour his own children, unless, indeed, such a one as
Thyestes ? or, if this could have happened, do you think he could be such
a fool as to eat a stone for a child, unless he was totally void of sense and
feeling ? Then, again, Jupiter and 1 never fought, neither did he take away
my empire by force; for I refigned it to him of my own accord ε and as to
my being in chains, and· thrown into Tartarus, here I am to convince you

to the contrary, unless you are yourself as blind as Homer.

P R I E S T.
But what induced you to refign your kingdom ?

SATURN.'

1 will tell you. I grew old and gout-v, (which, perhaps, was the reason
why the common people gave out that I was in chains,) and was no longer
able to encounter with the degeneracy of the times. l had nothing else to
do, indeed, but to run about, with thunder in my hand, after false swearers,
thieves‚ and villains·, which was a work of labour, and fit only for youth
to execute : I * gave it up, therefore, and a good deed it waS, to Jupiter.
Ι thought it withal most prudent to divide the empire amongst my sons, that
Ι might live and feast in peace and quiet, and -no longer trouble my-
self with importunate petitioners, for ever asking things different from, and
&inradietory to each other; that I might not always be sending down hail,
lig tuing, and thunder, but lead a pleasant old man's life, drink pure
metat, and tell stories with Iapetus, and the rest of my cotemporaries.
He, in the mean time, holds the seins of government, with a thousand
anxietics‚ and is in perpetual uneafiness; unless, except for a few days, when

* Gave it πμ] This is one of the severest picces of delicate and indite& satire, perhaps,
any where to be met with. Saturn gives up the dominion of heaven and earth, because they
were both so wicked and worthless‚ that it was neither honour nor pleasure to be at the head of

them.—A king of England, in this age of universal depravity and corruption, would, perhaps,
not be sorry to avail himself of such a privilege.
