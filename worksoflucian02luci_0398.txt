Crier, call in Herodotus; and here he is, let him stand forth and give his
evidence3 he will talk to you, as his custom is, in his own lonic dialect.
Thus it runs, “ ’Ψ What he has said, Ojudges, is true, and you may be-
lieve him when he afferts that the sight is preferable to the hearing, for the
eye is always less faithful than the ear.” You hear what the witness says,
and it is certainly true, for words have † wings, they fly off as soon as they
corne forth, and are no more; but the pleasure arifing from what we see is
solid and permanent: must not then a palace like this, so beautiful, and so
alluring, dazzle and confound the speaker? and of this you are yourselves
the strongest proof: for whilst Ι have been speaking, you were all employed
in admiring the structure, gazing at the roof, and turning your eyes to-
wards every picture: nor need you be afhamed of it: we must excuse you;
amidst such a variety of beauties, if you have any feeling, it is unavoidable,
for the workrnanship is excellent, History and Antiquity unite their charms
to allure you, and demand attention from every spectator of taste and judg-

“ But that you may not quite forsake me, 1 will endeavour to describe
them3 what it gives you so much pleasure to see, cannot be disagreeable in
the recital; Ι doubt not but you will even commend and prefer me to my

Ethiopian history; Perseus ssaying the monster, and freeing Andromache,
whom he afterwards marries3 in another part is represented his flight to the
Gorgon53 the artist hath contrived in a small picture to exhibit a variety of
objee'ts. The sear and modesty of the virgin, who overlooks the contest from
a high rock, the bold enterprize of the lover, and the terrible appearance of

χ Observe then, δικ] Most of the pidiures here described seem to stiew no inconfiderable
share of taste and genius in the composition of them ; how they were executed we cannot pos-

fibly tell, but by the grouping at the figures, and the manner of telling the fabre, we may be
assured that the art of painting had, in Lucian's time, attained to great perfeciion. Some of
the subjee‘ts are, perhaps, worthy the consideration of our ingenious modern artists.
