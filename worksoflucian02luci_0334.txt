he did the r;st; he had long hair, seemed filthy, and was ²⁵ blacker than
darkness itself: he endeavoured to lay hold on me, shifted fides, and tried
every methol to get the better of me, sometimes appearing as a dog, at
others as a bull, and at others as a lion. 1 took out the most dreadful in·-
cantation 1 could find, talked to him in the AEgyptian tongue, and forced
him at length, by the power of my charm, into a little corner of a dark
