cations, to place him near to AntiphiluS, and to bind him with the same
chain3 that he might embrace, assist, and though he was ill himself, take
care of his fick friend: thus did they both, with less pain and uneasiness,
support themselves under their common calamity. An event at length took
place, which, unexpeEtedly, put an end to their misfortunes: one of the
prisoners, having by some means or other procured files, by the assistance
of his fellow-captives, sawed off the great chain that linked them togethtr,
and set them all at liberty; they then easily murthered the few keepers, and
made their escape; they soon dispersed, and several of them were re-taken.
Demetrius and Antiphilus, however, remained there, having seized Syrus
just as he was getting off: in the morning, when the governor of AEgypt
heard of it, he dispatched his officers in pursuit of the fugitives, sending at
the same time for the two friends, whom with many commendatioris oftheir
behaviour, in not going away with the rest, he set at liberty. Demetrius,
however, not content with such a dismiffion, said he thought it would be an
affront on thern to receive their pardon thus as a favour or reward, he solicited
the judge, therefore, for a public trial, who granted it; and finding, on exa·
mination, that they were innocent, let them go, not without his praise and
admiration, especially of Demetrius, whom he presented with '²- twenty thou-
sand drachmas, out of his own private fortune, giving at the farne tiine half
as much to Antiphilus, to make them amends for the punishment which
they had unjustly suffered. Antiphilus is now living in AEgypm Demetrius
gave away all his fortune to Antiphilus, and retired amongst the Brach-
mans in India, saying, before his departure, that he hoped his friend would
forgive his leaving him, that, “ as for himself, he, who was content with
a little, could not want riches; and on the other hand, he, whose circurn-
stances were perfectly easy, could not stand in need of a friend.’'

Such, Toxaris, are our Greci-an friends. We are apt, you say,to dwell too
long upon things, I would otherwise have repeated to you what Demetrius
said upon the trial, pleading not for himself, but his friend, with tears and
supplications taking all the blame, in order to aequit him, till, at length, Syrus,
whipped into confeffion, acknowleged the eritne, and acquitted them both.

These few instances, out of many, being the first that occurred to my
memory, I have produced of good and faithful friends: Ι shall now take
my leave, and give the cause into your hands. Your ι πη is now to
