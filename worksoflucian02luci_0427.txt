THE W Ι S H E S. 421

When you corne to wissi, yourself, we‘ssiall see whether you are more ra-

tional, or not : in the mean 111116 Ι will have a purple garment‚ my costly
viands, and sweet ssumbers: friends will come to salute me, to pay their
respe&s, and entreat favours of me: crouds of people shall wall< early in
the morning about my door, and amongst them Cleaenetus and Democrates,
thofe great 111611 ; and when they desire to be admitted first to my presence,
Iwill have seven tall Barbarian porters, who ssiall 111111 1116 door against
them, as they do their’s against other's. Ι, when ir shall seem good to me
to arise, {hall come forth like the sun, and some of them I shall not dcign
to look at: but, if [should see a poor man there, such a one as vaas my-
self before my prosperity, him will 1 embrace cordially, order him 10 bathe,
and come, at the proper time, to sup with me. The rich shall be ready to
burst when they see my horses, chariots, and beautiful young women : then
will 1 be served in gold, for filver is too base a meral, and beneath me. I
will have my salt meats and my oil from Spain, my wine from Italy; my
honey shall not be ³* smoaked: I will have boars, hares, and other fine

eatables from all part33 my hens ssiall come from ψ Phafis‚ my peacocks
from India, my cocks from Africa: those who are to dress 1116111 for me
shall be learned sophists, and well (killed in cooking and fauces of every
kind. When I ‡d1·ink to any body, and he pledges me, he shall take
the cup away with him. Those who now call'themsclves rich, ffiall be all
beggars to me: no more shall Dionicus shew off his filver (1111165 311ἀ611115 ;
v especially when he sees my servants eat and drink out: of as good. 'l'he
whole ciry {hall taste of my bounty; for 1 intend to 1111116 presents every
11110111, 10 every native an hundied drachmas, and 10 ssrangers half as much.

A nonpnreil that went his lip in,
would strait become a golden pippin. Sic.

See the story in Ovid’s Met. book xi.

ἃ Smoaked] The common method of gathering honey was then, as, l believe, it is now,
by making a fire at 1116 mouth of 1116 111ν6, and smorhering 1116 bees, which probably gave a
smoky caste 101116 honey3 but the finer sort, or mel Atticum, we are told, colliquetzitur 11116
fumo, was gathered without smoak‚ 1. 6. by some other method.—Cum eximuntur mella, says
Pliny, apes abigi fumo utilifliinuxn : -servatur quod Acapnondicitur.

† Phasin] From whence 6011165 ρ11ε111ῖ111115, the pheasant‚ Le. of the pheasant kind.

ζ ll'hm Idrlnk‚ ἕξις] This piece ofpageantty was 011611 praCtised at festivals amongi't our
:uicellors‚ and, to this day, makes a part of the coronation ceremony, when the king drink> to
1116 champion of England, who receives 1116 cup, und takes 11 home with him.
