M I C Y L L U S.
That proud Sophist, you mean, who made a law against ‘r-‘tasting flesh,

* Tastingflcfh] The Pythagoreans had a very good reason for abstaining from flesh, as they
were persuaded that the souls ofmen transmigrated into animan, birds, &c- and that caing,
therefore, their flesh, might be feeding on their own relations; asOvid most charmingly and
poetically expresses their sentiments‚

Nos quoque pars mundi (quoniam non corpora solum

Verum etiarn volucres aninnae sumus, inque ferinas

Pnfl‘umusire domos, pecudumque in peetora condi

Corpora, quae poffint animas habuiffe parentum,

Aur fratrum, aut aliquo, junebrum foedere nobis,

Aut hominum, certe, tuta esse δι honesta ssnarnusz

Neve Thyesteaeis cumulemur viscera menfis.
See the fifteenth book of the Metamorphosis, where the whole Pythagorean system is beauti-
fully explained and illustrated.

scription of him in the sxxteenrh book ofthe lliad; he was afterwards ssain by Menelaus, Con-
ecrning the transmigration, see Ovid‚ ⁸
