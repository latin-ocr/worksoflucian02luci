LAPITHAE‚0RTHEBANQUET. 493

³* The pointed launce with erring fury ssew,

but unluckily hit the bride-groom, and gave him a deep wound on the sore-
head. The women cried out when they saw the blood run, and especially
his mother3 and after her, anxious for her spouse, the poor bride. Alci-
damas, in the mean time, who had taken the part of Zenothemis, perform-
ed most noble feats, having already cleaved the skull of Cleodemus, and
broke Hermon'sjaws with his club, befides wounding several ofthe servants
who opposed him. The other party, however, would not give out3 for
Cleodemus enraged, tore out with his fingers one of the eyes of Zenothemis,
andbit off part of his nose3 and, as Hermon was coming to his affistance,
Diphilus threw him down headlong from the seat. The grammarian, in en-
deavouring to part them, lost several of his teeth by a kick from Cleodemus,
who mistook him for Diphilus3 down he laid himself, and, to use the words
of his favourite Homer,
† Ejeffing blood.

At length there was nothing but crying and roaring on every fide ; the wo-
men got round about Chaerea, and wept over him : the rest of the company
endeavoured to put an end to the quarrel. Alcidamas did more mischief than
any of thern, ronting all that opposed him, and bearing every body he could
light on; many, Ibelieve, would have been killed by him, if he had nos
luckily broke his club. For my own part, I stood up against the wall and
avoided the fray, discovering, by the example of the poor grammarian, how
dangerous it was to interfere in things of this nature. It was, in short, the
feast of the Lapithae and the Centaurs; the rables were overturned, the cups
were toffed about, and blood spilt on every side.

At length, to crown all, Alcidamas threw down the candlestick, and
left us all in toral darkness ; the affair then grew still more serious, for we
could not eafily procure more light, which, when it was at last brought in,
discovered some very bad transaffions that had been carried on; Alcidamas
had been rude with a poor fidling girl, and Dionysidorus was caught in the
fa& of making away with a large cup, that fell out of his bosom3 he said,
by way of excuse, that Ion had given it him to take care of3 but Ion inform-
ed us, that the care was all his own.
