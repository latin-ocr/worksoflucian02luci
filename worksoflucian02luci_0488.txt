'482 LAPITHAE‚0RTH13BANQUET.

The conch, on the right hand, as you entered, was filled with a number*⁴
of women3 and, among-st them„ surrounded by her friends, the bride,
covered with a long vcil: opposite to* the door, was another large com-
pany, rangcd according to their rank and dignity. Over against the women
sat Euentus, and next him Aristaenetus: and now a little dispute arose,
whether the precedency should be given to the old Stoic Zenothemis, or
Hermon, the Epicurean, who was priest of vj* the Dioscuri, and of the·
first family in the city. Zenothemis cut this matter (hort, by crying out,
“ Is you place me behind that Epicurean, not to say any thing more of him,
Yssmll leave you to feast by yourselve53 I am going :'’ and so saying‚ he-
called the boy, and pretended to be marching off: upon which, “ Take
the first seat, if you please, (said Hermon 3) but, 1- think, however you
may despise the Epicurean, you might have given place to the priest.’' “ Ι
laugh at the priest and the Epicurean t00‚'' replied Zenothemis3 and im-
mediately sat down, and Hermon next him ε then cleodemus, the Peripate-
tic; then«Ion; and, after him, the bridegroom: I followed; next to me “
sat Diphilus3 and, below him, his scholar Zen0,2 with Histiaeus and Diony--

fodorus.

the ssower of each.

He is not like the generality of rich men, but a lover of the wife and
learned, with whom he has spent the greatest part of his life. But to pro--
ceed: the first part of the evening paffed off quietly; we had an elegant
and plentiful supper: you do not want an exa& account of our meat and
drink3 it is sufficient to say, we had enough of every thing. In the midst
of the entertainment, Cleodemus leaned over, and whispered to Ion:
‘⁴ Look (for I overhearclrthem) at that old fellow, (meaning Zenothemis)
how he gorges> the harh ! his cloaths are all daubed with the soup :⁷ observe

⁴ lbivmm] The women, we see, had a couch to themselves, and did not fit amougst the
nzen: no wonder that the feast should resemble that of the Lapithae, nothing but noise and:
