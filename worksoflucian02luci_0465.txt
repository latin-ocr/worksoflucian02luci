SATURNALIA.
'AoIALoGuE.

The Saturnalia, or Feast of Smmm, was celebrated in December: at this time

which, notwithstanding, fhrnzed no inconfiderable Part of the Pogon Crecd.

and Saturn, which was certainly putting, as we say, placing the cart before the horse, and puts
us ln mind of cardinal Woolsey’s ego δι rex meus. 1 have taken the liberty, however, and 1
hope my brethren of the clergy will forgive me, to place the king before me bissmp, and res-
tore saturn to his superiority.
