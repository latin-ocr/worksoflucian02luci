good friend Pelichus t00, it see1n5.'' ‘⁵ May be so, replied Eucrates, but
do not scoff, for he may be revengcd on you by and by: I know what
this statue, which you laught at so, has power to do; do you think, if he can
cure an ague, that hc cannot bring oue also ?” “ Kind then, said 1, and
propitious may he be to me! but what did he do, pray, to you who were
in the house ?‘’ ‘⁶ I will tell you, said Eucrates; as soon as night comes on,
he quits the pedestal which he stands on, and takes his walk round the‘
