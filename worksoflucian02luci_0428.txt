422, Tne W Ι S H E S.

I will rcpair and adorn the public theatres and baths : the sea shall come up
to the double gare, and the water shall be brought up from the harbour in
a large ditch, so that my ship may lay up close by me, and be seen even
from the ³¹⁶ Ceramicu‘s. My friends here will not be forgotten: to Samip-
pus I {hall order my steward to deliver twenty measures of stamped gold;
to Timolaus five ψ chaenixes; to Lycinus but one, and that clipped, be-
cause he is a prater, and makes ajcst of my wifh. This is the life 1 mean
to lead when I grow rich, enjoying mysclf freely, and revelling in pleasure
and delight. Ι have donc3 and may Mercury grant what I have defired ἔ,

But, all this while, know you not by how ssender a thread all these siches

I mean, it is very uncertain how long you may live to enjoy them: who
knows, but as soon as you are set down to your golden table, before you
have touched any thing at it, before you have tasted your pea-hen, or your
African cock, your breath may be stopped‚ and you left a prey to crows
and vultuis. Need Icall to your remembrance numbers who have ch'ed
without ever enjoying their wealth‚ and others whom some envious daemon
has deprived of their siches even in their life-time ? Did you never hear of
Craesus and Polycrates, who were cut off from all their prosperity in a very
{hort space of time? But, to pass over this, who shall promise you health
and strength for years to come ? have you never seen the rich laid up with
dreadful disorders, some scarce able to walk, others blind, others afflieted
with some secret and crue] disquietude? You would not, 1 arn sure, for all
hiz aalma, suffer what Phanomachus did, or wish to be effeminate like him3
not [o mention [hat envy and hatred which are ever attendant on the great,
and the snares perpetually laid for them. Do not you perceive already how
much trouble these riches bring along with them?

⁸ Ceramicus] A place within the city of Athens, containing temples‚ theam-es, porticos:
there was likewise another place so called in the suburbe, which was a public burying-place, and
from which there was probably a distant view of the harbour.

-Ι Chaenix.] A measure containing two sextarii, or four cotulae. A κοτυλη, according to Ar-
buthuut’s Attic measures of liquids‚ was half a pint3 the chaenix, therefore, contained two
quarts.
