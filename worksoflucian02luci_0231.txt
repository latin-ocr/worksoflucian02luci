l'CARO-MENIPPUS. 225

Those prayers which he thought right and proper he let up thmug'n the hele,
and blew the wicked and foolish ones back, that they might not risc to
heaven : one petition, indeed, pnzzled him a little3 two men asldng favours
of him, direftly contrary to each other, at the same time, and promising the
same sacrifice3 he was ata loss which to oblige; he became immediately a
perse& Academic, andslike ³³⁵ Pyrrho, was held in suspense between them.
When he had done with the prayers, he sat down upon the next chais, over
another hole, and listened to those wholwere swearing and making· vows ε
when he had finished this bufiness, and destroyed Hermodorus, the Epicn-
rean, for perjury, he removed to the next seat, and gave audience to the
auguries, oracleS, and divinations; which having dispatched, he proceeded
to the hole that brought up the sume of the viStims, together with tlte
name of the sacrifices. Then he gave out his orders to the winds and storms :
“ Let there be rain to—day in Scythia, lightning in Africa, and snow in
Greece; do you, Boreas, blow in Lydia, and, whilst Notus lies still, let the
North wind raise the waves of the Adriatic, and about a thousand messuros
of hail be sprinkled over Cappadocia.'’

When Jupiter had done all his business, we repaired to the feast; sor it
was now supper-rime, and Mercury bade me fit down by Pan, the Coryban-
tes, Attis, and Sabazius, a kind of demi-gods, who are admitted as vifitors
there. Ceres served us with bread, and Bacchus with wine3 Hercules hand-
ed about the flesh, Venus scattered myrtles, and Neptune brought us fish;
not to mention that I got ssb'ly a little neetar and ambrofia ; for my friend
Ganymede, out of good-nature, ifhe saw Jove looking another way, would
frequently throw me in a cup ortwo. The greater gods, as † Homer tells
us (who, Isuppose, had seen them as well as myself)‚ never taste meat or
’ wine, bnt seed upon ambrofia, and get drunk with neetar, at the same time
Α their greatest luxury is, instead of vifihmls, to suck in the furnes that rise
from the vietims, and the blood of the sacrifices that are offered up to rhem.
Whilst we were at supper, Apollo played on the harp, Silenus danced

ἱ Pyrrh0.] Of Elis, founder ofthe Sceptic feet, who doubted of every thing. 'He flouriihed
about the hundred and tenth Olympiad.
† Homer tells us.]
Ου ’γαξ οιτον edens, Β πινεσ’ memrot οινσν.
Not the bread of man theirlife sustxiins,
Nor wine’s inflaming juice supplies their veins.
