COCK.

How this soul of mine, which came originally frorn ’ἴ Apollo, flew down
to earth, and got into a human body, as a punishment for its crimes, it
would be tedious to recount3 befidcs, these are things which it is neither
lawful for me to tell, or you to hear. When, therefore, 1 came to be

Tell me first, my miraculous friend, who Ι was formerly; was I trans-

formed like you Ρ

Certainly. M Ι C Y L L U S

Who was 1 then? can you tell me? for l long to know.

You were an *3* Indian pismire, one of those that dig up the gold dust.

MICYLLUS.

Why was I so idle then, as not to pick up a few grains for myself‚ and
bring them into this life of mine, where Ι want them so much: but what

{hall 1 be hereafter? tell me that, if it is any thing good, 1 will hang myself
immediately on the post you are perched upon.

The future we know nothing οἷς but to go on with my story ε when 1 was
Euphorbus, 1 fought at Troy, and was killed by Menelaus3 after which 1
was transformed into Pythagoras; but some time inoervened, during which
1 remained without a mansion, till ’,ξ Mnesarchus thought fit to prepare mo

one.
MICYLLUS.

And were you all that time without meat or drink?

*k From Apella] Pythagoras, who, like other system-mongem, was ambitious of appear-ing
as something supernatura] and divine, endeavoured to persuade the populace that he was Apollo,
who had descended to earth, to reform and insti-u& mankind, See Porphyry and Jamblichus.

ἦ· Indiam pismire.] lt is well known that pismires‚ in digging for a place to depolit their eggs,
throw up little heaps of earth ; it is not improbable, therefore, but that they might, as the
ancients believed, give rnen the first intelligeuce of those places where gold was to be found,
by calling out some of the dust, and thus informing them where they were to dig for it.

Inda cavis aurum mittit formica metallis. Proper.

The Coek, by telling Micyllus he had been an Indian pffmire, only means to refle& on his
avarieious temper.
