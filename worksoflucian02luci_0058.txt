about his own pretenfions, attacked Bagoas, and began to find fault with

There, I think, Lycinus, they were both in the right: the greatest part
of the dispute should have turned on this point : had 1 been the judge myself
I should have dwelt particularly on that, should rather have enquired who
was the best livet than who was the best orator, and decided accordingly.

You say well, 1 arn entirely of your opinion: at last, however, when
they had abused one another sufficiently, Diocles infisted on it that Bagoas
was not fit to teach philosophy, as being an eunuch ; that he could have
no title therefore to the reward ; that such creatures were not only excluded
from things of this kind, but from lustral vases, sacrifices, and all public
ass'emblies3 and that it was always counted an r ill-ornen’d and abominable
fight if one met any of them when we went out in a morning: he said a
great deal likewise about their being neither man nor woman, but a kind of
strange and wonderful mixture, and something odious to human nature.

clude eunuchs from philosophy, when even women profeffed it3 and then he
brought in Aspasia, Diotima, and Thargelia to support his cause; and also
an ἦν Academie from Gaul, an eunuch like himself, who flourished in Greecc

eunuch as an ominous sight.

mentioned by Philostratus; who, though an eunuch, was tried and convicted as an adulterer.
