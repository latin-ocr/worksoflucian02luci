Tne FALSE PROPHET. 9

J how it could be done, would at last, if he could not find out the method,
conclude that it must be nothing but an artant falsehood, and utterly im-
practicable.

ln a short tirne, all Bithynia, Thrace, and Gallo—Graecia flocked in to this
speetacle3 every one afferting, as you may suppose, that he had seen the
god born, and touched him3 thathe had grown immensely in a few days;
and that he had a face like a man. They made, moreover‚ pictures, sta-
tues, and models of him3 some of brass, and others of filver, with the name

, of the god inscribed upon thern3 for he was called Glycon, from an oraculas

verse which Alexander had taken care to publish; which said,

Behold, the third from Jove, great Glycon comes,
The light of rnen.

When the time was now come to bring on the great affair for which the
whole was contrived, he began to think of setting up the oracle, after the
manner of ⁸ Amphilochus·² who, after the death of his father AmphiarauS, at
Thebes, banished from his native country, and driven into Cilicia, made a
good fortune there by prophesying to the inhabitant53 taking two oboli of
them for every oracle. Alexander, ψ taking the cue from him, gave out
that the god would deliver oracles on such a day: he then ordered every
body to write down in a book what they wanted to knOW‚ tye it down with
thread, and fasten it with wax or clay. He then retired into the sanstumy,
(for the temple was now built, and the scene of aetion prepared‚) summon—
ed them together by a cryer, had his high-priest by his fide, as if the god
had now done all his business, and read what they had written; returned
every one his book, scaled up as at first3 with the answer to every question
in verse.

The trick was such as you, or Ι, ifI may say it without vanity, might
very eafily find out, though to the ignorant and foolish, it might seem im—
pradficable. For knowing how, of which there are various meffiods, to
loosen the seals, he read all the questions, and gave what answers he thought·
proper to thern, then rolling up and re—sealing, gave them back to the [α

³* Amphilochus] Succeeded his father Amphiaraus in the business of divination by dreams,
for which both the oracles were famous. For an account of the latter, see Potter’s Antiq. vol. i.
