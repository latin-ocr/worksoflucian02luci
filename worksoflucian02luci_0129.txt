question3 as there are many Amastrians now alive, who rcrnernlaecr the com-
bat of Sifinnes.

I will now give you for my fifth instance the story of Abanelms, and then
I have done. This man came sometime ago into a city ofthe Borysthenes, with
a wife whom he was extremely fond of, and two children, one a boy then at
the breast, the other a girl about seven years of age. l-le was accompanied
by his old friend Gyndanes, who was lame from a wound in his thigh that
he received in refisting some robbers on their journey, and which was so
painful, that he was not able to stand. It happened, that they were lo ‘god
at- the upper part of the house, and in the middle of the night, whilll they
were all asseep, a great fire broke out, and the whole house was surroundcd
by the flames. Abanchas being awakened‚ left his children who were cry-
ing round him, and pushing away his wife who had laid hold of him, ad-
vised her to ssiift as well as ssie could for herself; and taking his friend on
hisss10u1ders„ made the best of his way out, escaping at that part of the build-
ing, where the fire was least fierce: the woman followed with the infant in
her arms, and the girl after her: half-burned herself, she let the boy fall,
and, together with the girl, with great difficulty got through the flames, at
the peril of her life. WVhen Abanchas was afterwards reproached for leav-
ing his ³⁵ wife and children, and carrying out Gyndanes, “ Ι may easily get
more children, said he, and it is uncertain whether thoseI had would turn
out good or bad, but Ishould not eafily find such another friend as Gyndanes.

Ι have nOW, Mnefippus, out of many examples which Ι could have pro-
duced, selected five only ε it is now time to decide whether my hand or your
tongue is to be cut off. Who 1hall determine this point?

Nobody; *for we never fixed on any arbitrator. What are we to do then ?

fince at present we have only aimed our darts at random, and at no particular
mark, let us choose an umpire, and produce other examples before him;
then the vanquissied must suffer, andI must lose my tongue, or you your
hand. But if,'after all, this appears rather savage and uncourteous, fince
you on your part seem to have the highest opinion of true friendship, and I

θ er and children] This story, it must be acknowleged‚ though it may redound to the ho-
nour οἱ Abanchas, with regard to the delicacy of his friendship, gives us but a very moderate
idea of his conjugal affeffiom nor does it, indeed, pay any great compliment ro the ladies, who

will be ,pleased, however, to remember, that this was a Scri-rimu, and not an Exorat«
husband.
