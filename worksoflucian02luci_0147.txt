road with a large burthen, they permitted me to rest for that night, but next
day, putting a blind over my eyes, they fastened me to the bearn of the mill-

wheel, and would have drove me on: Ι knew well enough how to grind,
asI had often been forced to learn it, but pretended ignorance3 this, how-
ever would not do, for a number of the louts got about me, and, taking sticks,
laid on me in such a manner, that I spun round like a top, and found by
experience‚ that a servant, who has work to (lo, need not wait for his mas-
ter’s hand to make him go about it. I soon grew weak and emaciated, and
my master, resolving to get rid of me, sold meto a gardener. Here my
bufiness was to carry herbs every day to market for him, which, *when he
had sold, he drove me back to the garden, where I remained idle whilst he
was digging and planting. My way of life, however, was not very agree-
able3 sor, winter coming on, he had nothing to buy straw with, either for
me or himself3 besides, that Ihad no fhoes, and was forced to walk, some-

weapon from him, and throwing it a good way off, fell upon, and mauled -

him dreadfully z the soldier, seeing himself in such bad plight, laid still, as if
he was dead with the woundS, which so terrifiecl my master, that leaving him
on the ground, he took the sword, leaped upon me, and rode off as fast as
he could towards the city 2 when he came there, he gave up his garden to a
friend to take care of for him; and, for fear of danger, concealed both me
and himself at the house of a particular acquaintance in the city. The next

up in a chest, and took me, tied my legs, and carried me up stairs, into a
