ONDANCING. 47

The perfe<ffions of dancing 1 have already enumerated; it is fit I should
now take notice of its fault53 those of the body have been just now mention-
ed: what concerns the mind may be eafily discovered ε many <lance-rs, from
ignorance (and it is impoffible all should be wife), commit dreadful sole-
cisms; some move irregularly, and, as we say, out of time and tune, the

' foot pointing out one thing, and the 11111116 another: others dance in tune,
but mistake the period of time and the circumstance of aetion. I remember,
for example, when a man was to represent in a dance the birth of'Jove, and
the cruelty of Satnrn in devouring his children, 116 confounded it with the
missortunes of Thyestes; and another, who was to perform the part os
Semele, who is consumed by lightning, ran into the story of Glauce, both
betrayed into it by the fimilitude of the events. But the art itself is not to
be condemned or despised for the fault of the arrisi, but those only are to
take the blame who are ignorant and unss<ilful; and those, on the other
hand, to be applauded who do every thing properly, and according to the
rules of art. Upon the whole, the dancer should be exact and perfect, tal<-
ing care that all is beautiful, consonant, and liarmonions, superior to criti-
cism, deficient in no part, but excellent in 2113 acute to discern, deeply
learned, and, above all, possessed of humanity and benevolence: then will
his praise be complete, when every spectator shall in the dancer behold
himself, and see, as in a glass, every thing which· he is used to think and to
do: then will they not be able to contain themselves for joy, but will break
forth into rapture, at finding the image of their own minds thus reflected on
them. The Delphic precept of “ know thyself,” is thus fulfilled by means
of this noble speetacle, they go from the the-atre instructed in what they
are to follow, and what they are to avoid, and are there taught that whith

before they were totally ignorant of.

But there is in dancers, as in oratory, a kind of false energy‚ or affecta-
tion, which sometimes carries them beyond the proper bounds of imitation:
{f they are to represent any thing great, they make it immense ; if tendet,
effeminate; if manly and robust, rustie and savage: an instance of which 1
remember in a dancer of the first character, and who in every thing else de-
served the highest admiration, but unaccountably fell into this error from an
exceffive desire of pleafing, and performing the part of Ajax, so overacted Δ

it, that he seemed not to imitate a madman, burto be really so: he tore the
