4 ALEXANDER;0R‚·

Alexander being now grown up to man's estate, his beauty gone off, and
his master dead, found himself but indifferently provided for, and began to
confidet what extraordinary way of life he should turn to; and meeting by
chance with a chronicle-writer of Byzantium, a fellow ofan infamous charac-
ter, whose name I think was Cocconas‚ they travelled about together as jug—
glers, * {having the FAT nanos, (for so the wife men used to call the
ignorant multitude.) ln their journey they met with a Macedonian wo-
man very rich, one who was a little advanced in years, but would fain ap-
pear lovely and defirable ; out of her they got what they wanted, and fol-
lowed her from Bithynia into Macedonia ; sor she came from † Pella, which
in the time of the kings of Macedon had been a famous city, but could now
boast of few, and those very poor inhabitants. Here they met with some
serpents of a prodigious fize, but quite tame and gentle, so that women fed,
and children ssept by them 3 they would be trod upon without turning, and
sucked milk like infants. They have many of them, it seems, in this place3
(hence probably the fable of Olympias took its rise, and some such serpent
corresponded with her when she was with child of Alexander the Great.)

One of the most beautiful of these they purchased for a few oboli : and
this, as Thucydides says, was the source of the battle. For when these two
infamous enterprizing villains, who stuck at nothing, got together, they soon
discovered that this life is entirely governed by the two paffions hope and
sear, and that he who makes a proper use of them on every occasion, will
quickly grow rich : and with regard to both these, the knowlege of futurity‚
they perceived, was of all things the most neceffary, and the most defirable.
This it was that made ἶ Delphos, Delus, Claros, and the Branchidae, so
famous and so opulent3 men continually flocking to them, (urged by those
same tyrants which Ijust now mentioned, hope and fear‚) to enquire into

fellows, for the ignorant and vulgar. The analogy is more extraordinary, as the Greek expres-
fion is not a common one. q
