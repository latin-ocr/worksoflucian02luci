On TmeYRIANGODDESS. 505

for he had left it unfinished3 which being granted, he went over, made an
end of it, and spent the remainder of his life there. The king, in confide—
ration of his extraordinary merit and virtue, caused a brazen statue of him
to be erected, done by Hermocles the Rhodian, which remains in the tem-
ple to this day. It is in form like a woman, but in a man's apparel, which
was afterwards, for certain reasons, changed ro a woman’s. Some of Com-
babus’s friends, we are told, out of stark love and kindncss, put themselves
into the same condition with him, and led the same life; hence arose the
order of galli, or priests, who officiare in women's dreffes. Some people
will bring the gods into this affair, and inform us, that Juno fell in love
with'Combabus, and, to comfort him under his missortune, inspired others
with the strange resolution of doing the same as he did, that he might not be
the only man who ever laboured under such a misfortune: be this as it may,
such is the feet. 1 shall mention, by and by, how the priests are buried, and
why they do not corne into the temple 3 but 1 must first speak of the fize and

fituation of this noble edifice.
The temple is built on a hill, stands in the middle of the city, and is

surrounded by two walls, one of which is extremely ancient, the other of a
very modern date; the vestibule, which is about an hundred paces in ex-
tent, fronts the north3 here stand the Phalli, ereeted by Bacchus, an
’Ἠ hundred and eighty feet high ; on one of these a man gers up twice every
year, and remains at the top of it for seven days; the common people ima-
gine that at these times he converses with the gods, who, being nemer, can
better hear his prayers and interceffions, in behalf of the Affyrians; accord-
ing to others, it is in memory of Deucalion, and the time of the deiuge,
when men climbed up into mountains and high trees, to escape the flood.
For my own part, Ithink this account improbable, and that it isv rather in
honour of Bacchus3 for, whenever the Phalli are erected to him, the people

always place wooden men upon them, though for what reason Ι cannot say;
it is, however, Ι believe, in imitation ofthese that the man is sent up; and

in this manner3 a chain is tied round him, and the Phallus, and, as he gets
up, he throws the chain behind hirn3 as you may have seen men in Arabia,
AEgypt, ancl other places, climb up the palm-tree53 when he is at the top,
he throws down another long rope which he carries with him, and draws up

the original text ; the commentators have tried, but in vain, to conen ir.
