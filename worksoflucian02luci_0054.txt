48³³ owDANCING.

robe of one of the dancers in ²²⁴² iron ssioeS, vtook the flute away from another
who acted Ulyffes, and, as he was rejoicing in his victory, broke his head
with it, and wounded him in such a manner, that if it had not been for the
headpiece, that took off the soree of the blow, our poor Ulyffes had lost his
life by attacking a madman : the common people, who could not distinguish
right from wrong, thought it the finest imitation they ever beheld3 and the
better sort, who blussied for the performer‚ did not condemn him by their
silence, but endeavoured to cover his error by their applause, though they
eafily perceived that it was the dancer’s madness, and not that of Ajax: our
noble performer, however, not contented with this, did something stillrnore
ridiculous; for, leaping into the middle of the theatre, he sat himself down
between two persons of the ψ first rank, wh'o were not a little frightened lest
he should have taken either of them for a ram and flogged him z some were
surprised at this strange behaviour, others laughed‚ and many began to
think, that from extraordinary attention to his part, the rnan was actually
run mad: they say that when he came to himself, and was conscious of
having appeared like a madman, he fell fick with grief: it was plain, in-
deed, he was greatly affeeted by it, for, being afterxvardsffdefired to perform
the same part again, he recommended another, and said upon the stage, ‡ it
was enough to play the fool once in his life ε but what gave him the most
uneafiness, was the success of a rival, who, being appointed to succeed him
in Ajax, did it so well as to gain universal applause‚ keeping within the pro· s
per limits of his art, and not spoiling the imitation by madness and excess.
Ihave laid, my friend, these few observations before you on dancing,
that you may no longer be -so angry with me for admiring it; and if you will
accompany me to the theatre, Ι am sure you will be a captivated, and soon
be fond of it even to madnes33 Ι {hall have no reason to say with *f Circe,

’ἡ ls0‚=2s['⁷02vs.] Wooden ssioes we have seen, but the praffice of dancing in iron thoes is, Ῑ be-
lieve, confined to antiquity‚ as Ι do not reineniber it has yet been adopted amongst us ; though
a dance of ladies in pattens might poffihly, from the novelty ofit, have no bad effee't5 but this
