260 THEPAASITE.

them in abhorrence, and even frequently run away to avoid them. In·
other ans, parents reward children according to their merit ; give the boy
some vietuals if he has wrote well, or if he has NOT, give him none; of such
consequence is this same cating, that both reward and punishment are deter-
mincd by it ι now the parasite eats every day. In other arts this is the fruit
of all their learning, :ind they receive it with joy after the task is over; but
the way to it is rough and. difficult : the parafite alone enjoys the fruit of his
art at the rcry time when he is learning it; and even as soon as he begins,
attains the end desired. Not only some other arts, but every one of them
are praetised to gain a maintenance3 whilst the parafite gets one the moment
he enters upon it. The husbandman does not till his* field for the sake of
agriculture, nor the builder build houses for the sake of architecture; but
the parasite has nothing else in view but the thing itself3 his business, and
the 'end for which it was undertaken, is one and the same.

Again ε in other arts, rnen are perpetually employed, and have only two οι·
three holidays in a month3 for some places have annual, others monthly
festivals, on which they are allowed to be merry3 but the parasite has thirty
holy-days in the mouth, for every day to him seems holy..

In other arts, those who would arrive at any proficiency in them, must be
dieted like fiek; men for he that ears and drinks abundantly5 will never learn
much. In other εἴτε, the workman can do nothing without his tools; there
is no singing without a sture, nor playing without a lyre, nor riding without·
a horse3 now, our art is so commodious, and so easy to the artifi, that he‘
can exercise it without any instrument at all. *For other arts, we give some-
thing to learn them, but in this we receive for it: others, moreover‚ require

a master, but this none : for, as Socrates says of poetry; it comes by inspira‹

tion: add to this, that other arts cannot be practised when you are at sear.
or upon a joumey, but this may.
