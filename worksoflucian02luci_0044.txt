And now I will enumerate those qualities which the dancer should be pos-
seffed of, how he should be prepared, and instru&ed‚ and by what means
his knowlege rnay be strengtbened and confirmed; by which you will per-
cene, that this art is not to be numbered amongst the eafiest and most prac-
ticable, but reaches to the ’Ὦ summit of all human learning z comprehending
mufic, numbers, geometry, with your favourite philosophy, both natural
and moral, though it doth not hold the subtilty of disputation by any means
necessary. Oratory, however, it would not despise‚ but lays claim to a part
of it, as far as concerns the paffions and affeffions of men: nor must it be a
stranger to painting and statuary, as it can imitate their symmetry and pro,
portion, in such a manner as neither Phidias nor Apelles can be superior to
it. But, above all, it will be necessary for the dancer to have a great and
comprehensive memory: for, like Homer’s Calchas, he

† Must know the past, the present, and to come.

That nothing may escape him, as it is an imitative science, he must be able
to point out and express the thoughts of men t what Homer, therefore, at·
tributed to Pericles, the good dancer must also enj0y; a power of under-
standing what ought to be done, and of praetifing it also. How heis to do
this, Ι will now consider. ’

The first great requifite is a knowlege of ancient history, a perse& rememe
brancc, as 1 before observed, and a proper representation of it, He must
know every thing, therefore, from chaos and the origin of things, down to
the times of AEgyptian Cleopatra3 with all that passed in the intervalg. as, the
ξ castration of Coelum, the birth of Venus, the battle of the Titans, the naz
tivity of Jupiter, the fraud of Rhea, the stone, the imprisonment of Sarum,

Iieve it is the only one in it), in one of our farces, where the 'dancing-master observes,
that the young lady’s imprudent condus} can be attributed to nothing but her never having learn-
ed to dzrnce.

and unneceffaryg it would surely be sufficient to observe, in support of his labour⁹d panegyric on
the art, that the dancer sstould be acquainted with every part of ancient history, fable, and my-

It is observable that some of the tales alluded to are not mentioned by any author but Lucian,
