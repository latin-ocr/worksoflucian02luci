strait hairs out of his beard, properly administered, and with some certain
words suited to the occafion, may do much, but not in disorders of the feet.
I thought formerly, replied Cleodemus, as you do, that it should be a
hind’s skin, because the hind is swift-footed; but a certain African, well
sszilled in things of this nature, latelys informed me that lions were swifier
than hinds, for they frequently pursue and kill them. Every body present
agreed in commendation ofthe African, who, they said, was certainly in [116
right. And do you really think, cried I, that a man can be cured by
charms and incantations3 that external applications can remove the dil'orr'cr
that is within? At this speech of mine they all laughcd immoderately, plain-
ly despifing my folly and ignorance, in not knowing things which were so
clear and evidenr, that no man in his senses would ever dare to contradi&
them. The phyfician alone seemed plcased at my question, who, 1 suppose,
had himself been laughed at for advifing his patient to abstain from wine,
live upon vegetables, and not talk so loud. Cleodemus fimpered, and said,
ἐς Does it appear, Tychiades‚ so incredible that these remedies ihould be of any

pose, what is clear to every body, that intermitting fevers may be cured,
and rhe bites of serpents charmed away by old women, and yet istiu-rc
things are done every day, why may not the other ?’' ⁶< Dinomachus, replied
I, you draw false conclufions, and as they say, only drive out one nnil wirh
another, for what youxmention can never be performed by the means which
you affign; nor will Ι ever believe ir, till you can convince 1116 thara fever

upon all you have advanced, therefore, as so many old women's fables.”

“ By your talk, said Dinomachus, you seem not to believe [hat there are
any gods, or you would not surely deny that disorders may be removed by
divine invocations.'' ‘⁵ That, said I, my friend, does by no means foll :

there may be gods, and yet all this be a lie. 1 am a devout worlhipper or'
