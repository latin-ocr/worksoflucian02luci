there must be‘gods; now, altars there certainly are, ergo, there must hc gods

also ε what say you to that?

Ha! ha! ha! when Ι have had my laugh out, Iwill answer )·ou; ha! ha!

TIMOCLES.

That, I think, you never will; but, in the mean time, pray tell me what

D A Μ Ι S.

anehor hangs by ; though, by tacking your altars and your gods together, you

church‚ and is one of those reproaches, which, as it is rendered serviceable to the cause 01¹⁷

superstition, her zealous defenders do not wilh to wipe away.
