This must be a wonderful dream, indeed3 Ilong to know what it was

that could give you so much pleasure.

I will tell it you with all my beart, for nothing ean be more pleafing to me
than the recolleffifimr ofit3 but when, good Pythagoras, will you entertain

me with your transformations ? C C K

When you have ssiaken the honey from your eye-brows‚ and left off
dreaming,: but, come, let us hear, that 1 mayjudge whether it carne through

the * horny gate, or the ivory one.

Neither.

Homer tells υς, there are but those two.

Away with your poet3 he knows nothing of dreams: some of the poor
ones, perhaps, which he saw but imperfee‘tly, for, you know, he was blind,
might perhaps corne that way ; but rnine came through golden gates, it was
cloathed in gold, all over gold, and let me tell you, brought a great deal

of gold along with it.
ν C O C K-

Talk not so goldenly, good Midas, for your dream is like his wiffi, made

⁷ up ofnothing but gold.
⁴ M I C Y L L U S.

O Pythagoras, what a quantity of it did I behold! so shining, and so
beautiful; what is it that Pindar says in praise of it in the beginning of his
finest ode, where he talks first of water ? do you remember?

⁴ Hmvgv gale] Homer, speaking of dream, tells us that,

Immur’d within the fiient bow’r of sseep,

Two portals firm the various phantoms keep,

Of ev’ry one5 whence flit‚ to mock the brain,

Of winged lies, a light fantastie train:

The gnte oppos’d, pelucid vah-es adorn,

And columns fair, incas’d with polisti'd horn3

KVhere images of truth for passage wait,

With vifions manifest of future fate.

See Pope’s Homer’s Odyffey, b. xix- l. 656.
This is a very indifferent transsation ofthe iines in Homer, but Ι have not time at present to
give my readers a better. See also the latter end of the sixth book of Virgil’s AEneid.
