Combabus, he departed with confidence and security, as well'knowing he
had at home a sufficient testimony in his favour. No sooner was he return-
ed, than the king immediately committed him to prison : and a little after
brought him to a public trial, before many of those friends who were pre-
sent before when he was sent abroad. He accused him openly of adultery,
with great warnith ; reproaching him for breach of faith and friendship, in
thus defiling his bed, and the most flagrant impiety towards the goddess,
in committing such a crime whilst employed so immediately in her service.
Many witnesses appeared against him, some affirming that they had seen
him in the guilty embrace: he was therefore unanimoussy condemned to
suffer that death which he had so highly dcserved. Combabus had hitherto
stood silent, without making any defcnc03 but as they were leading him to
punishment, he stopped short, and cried out that he had been condemned,
not for violating the marriage-bed, or wronging his master, but because the

I will make thee all the amends in my power; thy accusers thou shalt be
vrevenged on by their immediate death; 1 will give thee, rnoreover, gold,
silver, noi-ses, and rich attire. Thou {halt come into my presence, without
form or ceremony, and even into my private chamber when the queen is
within.’' The king spake, and it was done as he commanded ι the accusers
