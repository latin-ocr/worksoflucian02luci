all the waters of the deluge3 that Deucalion, at the time when this hap-
pened, built altars and a temple to Juno, close to this chasm. The hole l
saw is under the temple, and, at present, but small : whether it might for-
merly have been larges, l cannot say3 that which I was shewn is now very
inconfiderable. In confirmation of this, the inhabitants, twice every year,
bring water from the sea into the temple: this rask is performed, not by
v the priests only, but by all the people in Syria and Arabia, and beyond the
Euphrates, who bring the water from the sea, and pour it into the temple,
from whence it falls into the hole, which takes in an amazing quantity os
it: this, they say, was a law of Deucalion’s, instituted by him to comme-
morate both the general calamity, and their happy deliverance from it.
This is the ancient history of the temple3 though others affirm, it was
built by Semiramis of Babylon, who left behind her many monuments of gran—
deur and magnificence‚ who is supposed to have erected it, not in honour of
Juno‚ but of her own mother Dercete, a statue ofwhom I saw myselfin Phoe-
nicia3 it is a woman down to the waist, and terminates from thence in the
tail of a fifh: but the figure of her, at Hierapolis, is a perse& woman.
Their accounts of this matter are rather obscure : certain, however, it is,
that the pcople here look upon fifh as a thing sacred, and never touch it,
any more than pigeons, which, for the same reason, they must not eat:
these, they say, are forbidden, on account of Semiramis and Dercete, be-

cause one bears the form of a fifh, the other of a dove. The temple may,
very probably, be the work of Semiramis; but I cannot think it was de-

dicated to Dercete, nor that the AEgyptians, who abstain from fissi, do it on
her account, but have *a different reason for it.

There is, likewise, another sacred tradition, which I had from a man of
understanding, who informed me, that the goddess was Rhea, and the tem·
ple built by Attis, a Lydian by birth, and the first who instituted religious
ceremonies in honour of ,Rhea ε from him the Phrygians, Lydians, and Sa-
mothracians, had all their knowlege. From the time when he was casti-aed
by Rhea, he put on female apparel, and appeared as a woman, travelled
over the world, recounted his sufferings, and sung of Rhea: at length he
came into Syria, and the people beyond Euphrates refusing to admit him,
