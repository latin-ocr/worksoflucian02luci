Such doetrine as your's would confound every thing3 but we deserve to be
worshipped, if for no other reason, atlcast for this, that we can foretell every
thing that the Fates have dccreed.

A very useless privilege indeed, to be able to foretel what you cannot
teach them to avoid3 unless the man who knew he was to die by a sword,
could escape it by lhuttiug himself up3 but this you do not pretend to, foi·
Fate will carry him out a—hunting, and expose him to the enemy: Adrastus⁴
shall throw his spear at a boar, miss him, and kill the son of Croesus3 for so

the powerful Fates had long since decreed, and dircited the javelin. How
ridiculous was the prediCfion cf '³‘- Laius:

v} Beget no children, for the wrath of heav’n
Awaits thee, and the son shall ssay his father.

Unnecefsary is the admonium, when the event must come to pass ι in spite
of the oracle, he begat 3 child, and was ssain by him. I see no reason,
therefore, why you should be thanked for your prophecies. Ι shall say no-
thing of your obscure and ambiguous oracles, so worded, that there was no
knowing whether he who had paffed oveti?¹ Halys, was to destroy the
kingdom of Cyrus, or his own, for the oracle might mean either of them.

† Laius] See the Phaenissae ofEuripideS.

ζ quet, ἰείη] This was the answer given ro Laius hythe oracle of Apollo, which was afterwards
so exat-Trly and literally fulfilled 111 the destruffion of the unhappy Oedipus, and which furnish-

ed Sophocles with the subjerfl ofhis finest and most perfe& tragedy, of the Oedipus Tyrannus.

ξ Halys] The famous Croesus, king of Lydia, having seht to the Delphic oracle to know
whether 11 was decreed by Fare that he should pass over the river Halys in his march against the
Pernam, and how long the empire should remain 111 his hands, the oracle returned fot answer,
that il‘ he passed the river Halys he should destroy a great empire‚ and that his power should
remain unlhaken till 3 mule should fit on the V throne of Perfia.” Croesus was satisfied with the
reply, aud thought himself as safe as Macheth did, when the witches told him he

 

Need not fear any thing,
Tin Birnam wood should move to Dunfinane.

The answer of the oracle, like that of Shakspeare’s witches, was evasive. We did not tell you,
said the priests afterwards, whose kingdom was to be destroyed, your enemy’s, or your own;
and as 1ο the mule, it came to pass as we foretold‚ for Cyrus was the mule we meant, being
half Perfian, half Mede; a Pei-fian by his father, and a Madian by his mother.
