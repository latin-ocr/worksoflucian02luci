JUPITER coNFUTED,
ADIALOGUE.

The Intent of this Dialogue is evidently nothing Ιςβ than to turn into Ridicule the
whole abfitrd Systenz of Religion that fi) long prevailed in the Heathen World, and
particularly that Part of it which relatos to the Doe‘trine of Fau, or Predestina·
tion, which was full of Error and Incorfistency: it is, indeed, exac‘ily the Con-
verflztion of Milton’s Devils, where he tells us, they talked of

Fix’d Fate, free Will, Foreknowlege absolute,
And find no End, in wand'ring Mazcs lost.

Nothing can exceed the Freedont and Familiarity with which Luc1AN, in this, as
r well as in many other Paris os his Works, treats Jupiter, and the rest of the Di·
vinities ; but, as a very ‘²⁶ stnfible W‘iter observes‚—“ We mv be well cffured that
a Man conversam with the World, as Lucum was, would never have ventured
lo exposc the Gods of his Countrytnen to public Ridicule, had they not already been
the Objeffts of ficret Contempl among the polyhed and enlightened Orders ofSociegyss'

JUPITER, CYNISCUS.

COME not, Jupiter, to trouble you for riches, honours, or kingdoms,

which the greater part of mankind are so ambitious of, and which you
know not hom without some difficulty, properly to divide amongst them3
1 want but one thing of you, which you may very eafily grant.
J U P 1 T E R.
And may, Cyniscus, what may that be? if your defires are so moderate, 1
{han certainly comply with them.

C Y N I S C U S.
It is only to answer me this plain question.

U ἱ) 1 T Ε R.
A small request, and eafily granted; ask as many as you please.
