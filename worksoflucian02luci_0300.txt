294 ANACHARsrs.

Because our own exercises are of themselves sufficient3 besides that we

think it beneath us to imitate foreigners.
ANACHARSIS..
'l‘hat is not your reason; you are convinced, I am sure, that to tye up '
young men naked in this manner, by both their hands, and whip them, can
answer no good end whaffoever, either to the individual, or the whole com-
munity; and if ever 1 go to Sparta, and find them at this sport,1 shall certainly
be stoned for laughing at them, when 1 see them whipping theiryoung men
like so many thieves and robbers. That city, in my opinion, stands in need
of a good quantity of hellebore, which gives its public sanction to anyathing

so absurd and ridiculous,

Think not, my good friend, to gain the vietory by thus arguing without
an antagonist; you will find at Sparta enough who will be able to answer and
confute you. But, as 1 have told you all our customs, which you seem not
much to approve of, I have a right to beg in return that you will acquaint
me with your’s, that I may know how you exercise and bring up your Scy.
thian youth, and by what means you make them good and honest men.

To this, Solon, you have, no doubt, a fair claim, and I will give you an
exa& account of our laws and customs‚ though they are not so grand and
respectable as your’s, nor indeed any ways resembling them, as we never so
much as venture to give one another a ssap on the face ; we are rather afraid,
indeed, of the consequence: however, such as they are, you shall have them3
butI must defer it till ⁴¹³ to-morrOW‚ that I may have time to refle& a little
on what you have told me, and recolleet whatI am to inform you οἷς in
the mean time, we must part for the present, for it is almost dark.

⁰ Tra-marrata] An account of the Scythian customS‚ with Lucian‘s remarks upon them,
would have been a valuable traCt ; but Anacharsis, which we have reason to lament, probably,
did not keep his word, as no such piece is come down to ur».
