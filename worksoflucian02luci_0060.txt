54 THEEUNUCH.

charge; and now, sor the sake of the reward, Isuppose, he would willingly
retra& again. Upon this, there was, as you may imagine, a general laugh.
Bagoas was confounded, changed colour, put himself into a thousand pos·
tures, and fell into acold sweat: not caring to acknowlege the adultery,
though at the same time, he thought that the suspicion of it might be of ser-
vice to him in the present affair.

The circumstance was ridiculous enough, and must have afforded you no

small entertainment. But pray, what was done at last, and how did the

judges determine it?

They were not all of the same opinion; some were for stripping him as
they do the ssaves, and examining whether, so far as certain parts were con-
cerned, he might be dcemed 3 philosopher: others, to make the affair still
more laughable‚ voted for calling in some ladies, ordering him to speak
with them in private3 sending along with them some credible witness, to
prove whether he was able to philosophize. After all, when every one of
the company had split his fides with laughing, they agreed to dismiss the cause
to Italy, to be finally determined there.

The other, it seems, is still carrying on the affair, preparing his accusa·
tion, and has taken up the business of the adultery, though it must make
against himself rather than his adversary: thus, like a bad lawyer, hurting
his own cause. Bagoas, in the mean time, attends to other matters, and
frequently gives proofs of his manhood, hoping he may succeed, if he can
but ssiew that he has the abilities of ajack-ass.

This, after all then, my friend, seems to be the best criterion of philoso-
phy, and a demonstration not to be controverted. 1 ffiall wissi, therefore,
that my son (at present buta boy) may be poffeffed, not of eloquence or

understanding, but of certain parts, still more necessary to make a complete
philosopher.
