middle of the affembly, and commands filence, never suffering thern to play
the fool before the judgeS, to obscure or puzzle the cause by a multiplicity
of words, but obliging them to explain the naked saec, and that only. And
here, Anacharsis, in like manner, I constitute and appoint you an Areopa-
gite ι hear me as counsel in this cause, and impose silence on me when you
think Ι play the orator, and endeavour to deceive y0u; but give me leave to
go on, whilst I adhere to the point in question. We are not now in the heat

of the sun, so that a little longer conversation will never hurt us, the ssiade is
thick round us, and we have nothing else to do.

True, Solon, 1 am greatly obliged to you, for thus acquainting me with
your manner of determining causes in the Areopagus, where thejudges decide

and dire& every thing, as the soul presides over the body; we take care,
therefore, of the city, adorning it with noble edifices within, and securing
it by strong bulwarks frorn without: but our chief concern is the citizens
themselves, to preserve them in strength both of mind and body, that they
may be able to guard the commonwealth, and keep it free and happy, in
war and in peace. For this purpose, we commit our children first to the
care of mothers, nurses, and school-masters, to instruet them properly in their
early years ; but as soon as they begin to understand what is right and good,
when sear, ssia'me, and emulation spring up in their minds, we then employ
them in studies of a different kind, and inure their bodies to labour by exer·
cises that will increase their strength and vigour: we do not rest content with
that power of mind or body which nature has endowed them with, but en-
deavour to improve it by education, which renders the good qualities that
are born with us more conspicuous, and changes the bad into better; fol-
