⁶8 DEMONAX.

Demonax, you had one there.'' Another time, Demonax laughing at a coni,
mon Olympio wrestler, for wearing an embroidered coat‚ the fellow struck
at him with a stone, and made him bleed : every body present was enraged
at this, as ifthey had themselves received the blow, and cried out, he should
go immediately to the magistrate ε “ Not to the magistrate, my friends, said
he, but to the surgeon.” Happening one day, as he was walking‚ to find a
ring, he put upa note in the marhet-place, fignifying, that if any body,
who had lost such a ring, would come and describe the weight‚ the stone,
and the impreffion on it, he might have it again3 a handsome young fellow
carne and demanded it, but not proving any kind of right to it, “ My pretty
youth, said Demonax to him, take care of your own ring, for you have not
lost this.’' A Roman senator at Athens, brought his son to him, a most
beautiful youth, but rather weak and effeminate: “¹ My son salutes you,'''saidv
the father. ‘⁶ A handsome boy, indeed, replied Demonax, worthy of you,
and very like his mother.” He used to call a certain Cynic philosopher, who
was always dressed in a bear’s skin, not Onoratus, which· was his real name,
but* Arctefilaus. Being asked what was the summit of human happiness,.
he answered, liberty ; and the other replying that infinite numbers were free„
‘⁴ None, said he, but those who neither hope nor fear.'' “ That, said the other,.
is impossible, for we are allssaves to those two paffions :’' “ But if, said De·
monax, you properly confidet human affairs, you⁴ will find that they are
not worthy either os our hopes or fears, seeing that both happiness and‘ mi-
sery are here of such short durationss'*

Peregrinus the philosopher, commonly called Proteus, used to reproach
him for laughing too much, and being too familiar with people ς “ Demonax,
said he, you do not a& the † dog well :” “ No, Peregrinus, replied he, nor
you the man„’' When a certain natural philosopher was disputing about the
AntipodeS, he took him to a well, and shewing him his-own shadow in the
water, cried, “ Are these what you call the Antipodes ?’' Another man boasting
one day that he was a¹ great magician, and had a certain charrn that could>
persuade people to give him any thing he wanted; “ There is nothing so
surprisrng in that, said Demonax: Ι am a magician as well as you, and iffi
you will follow me to the baker's, you shall see me, with a little charm andv

⁸ Aretefflaus] A pun upon the Greek word αρκτος, arctos, fignifying a bear, and alluding
to his being dressed in a bear's skin. The joke is but a poor one.
