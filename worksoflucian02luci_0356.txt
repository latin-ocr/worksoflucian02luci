THE

ILLITERATE BOOK-HUNTER.

In LuciAN’s Time, as wellas in our own, there were more pretenders to Learning
ancl Science, than real PUffiffbe of them. One of these Coxcombs, whose Name,
lucklly sor him, is ποῖ transtnislcd lo us, is here treated with great Severi2y3 the
Ridicule isstrong and pointial, the Allzgsions and Comparifhns are in general appefite
νο she Sub—jesi, and the Slories introduced to illustrate it, well told and entertaining.

ELIEVE me, my stiend, what you are about will never answer the
purpose intended3 you imagine that by purchafiug a few good books,
you will get the reputation of a inan of learning, but, depend on it, that
will never happen ; for it will only be a stronger proof of your ignorance ε
because, in the first place, you do not always buy the best, but trust to those
who cry them up to you, though they know nothing of the matter. You

are only a bubble to those book-brokers, who tell you a parcel of lies about
them. Ι-Ιοκν, indeed, can you distinguish which are old and valuable, and
which are paltry and good for nothing? unless you call in the moths for your
counscllors‚ and judge of their merit by their being mouldy, and worm-
eaten3 for as to real knowlege and judgment of their value, how should
you come by it? But suppofing you have got all that the excellent ’²ss Calli-
nus, or the famous † Athenian, that laborious author, ever wrote, of what
service would the poffeffion of thern beto you, who know no more of their
use and merit than a blind man does of his mistress’s beauty? You read
them, indeed, with your eyes open, dwell on some a long time, and sszim
over others ; but that is nothing, unless you know the faults and perfectioris
os every one, unless you understand what they mean to inculcate, in what
st) le they are written, which are faithfully copied, which are genuine, and
which are spurious.

All this, you will say, I may know without being taught it ε but how,
Ibeseech you? unless, perhaps, like the ᾖ( 0Ῑά ffiepherd, you have been pre-

who was, probably, distinguissied-in that age, as our Johnson and Bryant are in this, for ex-
traordinary learning and knowlege.
