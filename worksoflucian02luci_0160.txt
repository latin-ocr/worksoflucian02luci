354 JUPITERCONFUTED.

CYNISCUS.

l suppose, I must not ask you, or Fare, or Providence, why that good
and just man Phocyon died for want, or, before him, Aristides; whilst
those debauched youthS, Callias, and Alcibiades, lived in affiuence and pro-
sperity : as well as the proud Midias, and Charops of AEgina, that infamous
sellow, who starved his own mother3 or again, why Socrates was condemn-
ed by the judges, instead of Melitus; or why the effeminate Sardanapalus
reigned in peace, whilst so many brave Persians were destroyed by him, for
murmuring at his aetions: why, in short, the θ(- covetous, the base, and
wicked, are prosperous and happy, whilst the good and pious are oppressed
by want, sorrow, disease, and every other calamity.

J op 1T ER.

But thou knowest not, Cyniscus, what punishments are reserved for the
wicked in another life, nor what happiness for the good and virtuous.

CYNISCUS.

You want to frighten me with the infernal regionS, with your Tityus, and
your Tantalus; when Ι am dead, I shall know whether there is any such
thing3 in the mean time lwould wish to live happily here, be the time ever
so short, though a score of † vulturs were to prey upon rny liver in the
shades belom nor would Ι thirst for ever in this life, like Tantalus, for the

sake of drinking nedhir with the heroes, in the Issand of the Blest, or repos-
ing in the ξ Elysian Fields hereafter.

ἦ ‘77³⁹ cavemus, ξἐῢ] “ Ῑ was grieved (say-‘² David), at the wicked. Ido also see the ungodly
in such prosperiry, they are in no peril of death, but are lusty and strong; they come in no
misforrune, like other folk, neither are they plagued like other men: these prosper in the
world, these have riches in possession ; and l said, then have 1 cleansed my heart in vain, and
washed my hands in innocency.” See Psal. lxxiii.

{- Vultur-L] Alluding to the punishment of Prometheus.

ζ Ερᾖαηβεῖιίε.] The happiness of the good and virtuous after death, according to the Pagan
sy stem, seems to have been merely negative, and to have consisted rather in an exemption from
pain and solicitude, than in the actual enjoyment of any pleasuoes, either mutual or corporeal.
'she arch-impostor, Mahomet‚ no doubt saw the absurdity of this plan, and allured his follow-
ers by the offer of a sensual paradise; and his scheme, though vifionary, and ill-founded, was
certainly a much more rational one than that of the heathen poets and philosophers. But, how
poor and contemptible are both of them, when compared to the glorious prospe& of immorta-
lizy, brought to light by the gospel os Christ !
