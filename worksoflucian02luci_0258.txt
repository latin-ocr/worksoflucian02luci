Geometry? T Y C H 1 A D E S.

No.

SIMO.

TYCHIADES.
What then ? Rhetoric mayhap? for as to philosophy, Ι know you are as

far from it as vice itself is. Ι
S I Μ Ο.

Yes, and farther too would 1 wilh to be if p0ffib1e; nor would l have you
think Ι am ashamed of my ignorance in that point: Iown 1 arn bad enough,

and even worse than you suppose me.

T Y C H Ῑ Α D E S.
May be so ; but these, perhaps, are things you never learned, on account

oftheir superior excellency, aud the difficulty of attaining them ε you may,
notwithstanding, be an adept in some of the common trades or profesfions, a
sinith’s, or a cobler's; for your fortune, I know, is too small, to do without

something of this kind. S Ι Μ O

True, Tychiade53 and yet I know nothing of them.

T Y C H 1 A D E s.
What other profession are you of, then?
S 1 M Ο.
What profession? a very fine one, 1 think, and when you know what it is,
you will think so too, and admire me for it; Ι affure you I am pei-feet master
of it, though I cannot explain it to you.

TYCHIADES.

What is it? ·
s 1 M o.

Icannot, as yet, properly describe it to you3 suffice it, at present, toin-
form you, that Ι have a certain arr, which I am a proficient in, and, there·
fore, arn not in want: what it is, you {hall hear another time.

TYCHIADES.

But l cannot stay so long. S Ι Μ O

NVhen you know it, you will say it is something very new and astonissiing.
T Y C H 1 A D E S.
For that very reason, I long to be acquainted with it.

S I M O.
Some other time, rny friend.
