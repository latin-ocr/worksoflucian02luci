10 ALEXANDER301t,

veral persons, who received them with astonishment, frequently crying out,
“ How could he poffibly discover this which I gave him myself, inclosed
fast under seals which could not be forged‚ unless lie were indeed a god,
and knew every thing ?''

How, you will perhaps say, could this be done? Iwill tell you: in
the first place then, my dear Celsus, he ⁹⁶ heated a needle in the firc, and
putting it under the wax, lifted up the seal, and read the b00k3 then by
means of the needle melting the wax again, easily fastened down both that
which was under the thread, and that which was round the seal. There is,
likewise‚ another method, when you make use of what they call the collyrium 3
this is composed of Brythian pitch‚ asphaltus‚ and transparent stone, mixed
with wax and mastic; which he first warms at the fire and wets with spittle,
then applies it to the seal, and takes offthe impreffion 3 the collyrium hardens,
he eafily reads the contents of the paper, then putting the wax on again,
claps on the new seal exastly resembling the original, and as perse& as ifit
had been taken on a gem. There is yet a third way of doing it, which Ι
will acquaint you with ε he would put lime mixed with the glue you make
use of for books, make it into a kind of wax, and place it wet on the seal,
then taking it off, (for it soon dries and grows harder than horn, nay even
than iron‚) gets an impreffion of it. There are befides these, several other
memoris, all of which it would be ridiculous to enumerate; especially as
you have mentioned them, with a great many other things in your book
against the magicians, which is excellently written, and conveys the most
uoefnlinstruefionstothereaden

Thus did he institute his oracle, and pour forth his divine knowlege, a&-
ing at the same time with the greatest prudence and discretiori, and always
adhering to probability; giving perplexed and ambiguous answers, some·
times totally obscure and unintelligible, which in all mades, he held, was
most neceffary and indispenfible. Some he would diffuade and turn away
from their purposes as he thought most convenient3 to others he would pre-
scribe a manner of living, and advise the use of particular medicines: for, as
l observed to you before, he had by him some excellent receipts, particular-
ly the cytxnide53 a new name which> he had given to an ointment famous for

ἕ Hmted, [afa] The same ingenious methods of opening letters, or at least something very

fimilar rothem, are, Ι believe, praetised to this day. But forfarther information on the sub-
