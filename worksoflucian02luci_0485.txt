*LAPITHAE‚

ADIALOGUE.

It has frequently been obfirved, by both Ancients and Moderns, that, to the Re-
proach of Human Nature, ‘wisi’ Men are meetlmes as foolssv as other People.
Luc1AN, to convince his Readers of this Truth, gives us an Account of a Εἰμὶ,
where the Philofhphers, who were invited to it, got drunk, abufhd, and beat one
another.- a Fae} which might very probably happen, and which Lucum here
describes with infinite Humour. ‘I he Parties concerned were, we may stappost’,
pretgy well known; and this Relation of their Behaviour must have cffirded no
small Entertainment to the Public.

The LAPITHAE, a People of THESSAL1A‚ at a great Fecfi, made on the
Marriage ofP1R1Tnous‚ their King, quarrelled with the CENTAUR s, fought,
and routed them .· in Allzfion to this, LUe1AN humoroqsty calls his PhilostJphers
Fecst, the LAPITHAE.

P H 1 L O.-
O, you had variety of entertainment, yesterday, at Aristenaetus's: the
philosophers, they tell me, had a great dispute; and the affair even
went so far, if 1 may believe Charinus, as to. end in blows and bloodshed.

But how came Charinus, my dear Philo, to know any thing of the rnat-

ter, when he did not sup with us ?
Ρ Η Ι L O.

He heard so, he said, from Dionicus, the phyfician, who, Ι suppose,

was one amongst you. Α
L Y C 1 N U S.

He was; but not from the beginning3 as he came in late, about the
middle of the battle, and a little before any wounds were given: his ac-
count, therefore, cannot be depended on, as he was not there when the*
quarrel began, nor acquainted with the cause of it.
