με THEWISHES.

ships, which you have neither bought nor built, with all this ease, and
that we cannot persuade the gods to let us have the privilege of swimming
a few leagues without being tired ? You may remember, when we went the
other day to AEgina, to Diana's feast, what a little boat we croffed over in,
for four farthings‚ all of us together : you were not ashamed then to keep
company with us 3 but now you are angry‚ and want to draw up the ladder
after you. Indeed, friend Adimantus, you grow too proud: you are so
great a commander, that you do not know who you are3 so elated with this
fine house you have got in the finest part of the city, and the ssaves you
have bought : but, by Ifis, Ι beseech you, my dear friend, bring us out of
AEgypt some of their Nilotic ³¹⁵ pickle‚ a few of their rags, a little oint-
ment from Canopus, an †ibis from Memphis, or, if your ship is able to
carry it, one of the pyramids.

Lycinus, we have carried the jest far enough: you see how poor Adi-
inantus blushes3 his ssrip is drowned with laughter3 it can never refist the
soree of the waves : but as we have still a good way home, let us divide it
into four parts, aud every one employ his share in wishing for something
from the gods ; it will make the time seem ffiorter, and, by indulging these
pleasant dreams, we shall divert ourselves. Every one shall wish for what he
likes ; and we will suppose the gods ready to grant it υς, be it ever so strange
or improbable. We {hall have one advantage, at least, frorn it, that
ne {hall know what use every man will make of his riches, and how he
would behave ir he could get poss'effion of them.

Timolaus, 1 heartily appi-ove of your scheme, and, when it comes to
my turn, shall be ready to make my wishes known. Ι need not ask Adi-
mantus whether he will join us in it, as he has already one foot on board
his veffel. Lycium, I doubt not, will be of the party.

If we must all be rich, be it so: leonsent, thatI may not be thought
capable of opposing the common felicity.

hamme, probably, because it destroyed the pernicious s·=·pents which infested t'nat country.
