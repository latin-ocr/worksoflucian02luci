On Tmolus· lofty heights‚ whilst Lydians fing
To the loud harp, and celebrate their king;
The ³¹* Corybantes rnadd'ning train,
Their Cretan mensures found,
Chaunting their Evoes o'er the plain,

To dreadful battle wakes the god of war ;

The trees their early buds expand,
When tender blades of grass appear,
‚And jocund spring leads on the year3
Whilst Philomela, all-night long,
Repeats her melancholy song3
And ψ Progne mourns, in tender strain,

All-pow’rful gout ! thy orgies solemnize.

Of a fick chamber, from the chearful light

Of Phoebus long excluded, and confin’d
