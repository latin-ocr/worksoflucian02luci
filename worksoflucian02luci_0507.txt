day. When the phyfician saw him, hc plainly perccived that he laboured
under no distemper but love, as he gueffed by his languid eye, pale com-
plexion, trembling voice, melancholy, and many other infallible symptoms.
Having discovered thus much, he laid his hand upon the young man’s
heart, and called all the household together, who paffed in revicw before
him, and whom he beheld with the utmost tranquility; till, at length, his
mother—in-law coming by, he changed colour, began to sweat‚ and was
seized with a violent tremor and palpitation of the heart ε this, at once, ex-
plained the cause of all. He immediately called in his anxious father:
“ Your son’s disorder (says he) arises from an injury received : he has no
pain or distemper, but love and folly : hc sighs for that which he can never
enjoy3 for he is fallen in love with my wife, whom I shall not part from.’'
This the phyfician said, on purpose to try him. “ Let me intrent you,
(cried the father,) by your phyfical knowlege and wisdom, do not suffer my
child to perish: it is not a wilful crime3 his distemper is involuntary : do

ν not let your jealousy make awhole nation wretched3 nor, when it is iu

your power to cure him, suffer his death to bring ignomin)¹ and disgrace on
your profeffion.’' “ Itis infamous (replied the phyfician) to make such a
request, and to force me to it would be the highest injury ; how would you,
who desire this of me, a& yourself, if he was in love with your own wife ?’'
‘⁵’ I would not (said he) refuse her to him, to preserve his lise: the loss of
a wife is by no means to be compared to that of a son.'’ When the phy-
fician heard this, “ Ast< me no more, (cried he ;) whatl told you before
was all a fiction ; it is your wife whom he doats on.''—The father, at
length, convinced of this, yielded up to his son both his wife and his king-
dom, and retired himself to the neighbourhood of Babylon, where he built
a city, called it: after his name, and died there. Thus did this sage phy-
fician discover the disease of love, and cure it also.

lt is reported of this Stratonice, that, in her first husband's time, Juno
appeared to her in a dream, commanding her to build a temple at Hiera·
polis, threatening her with many dreadful missortunes if she should disobey
the divine mandate : at first she took no notice of the admonition3 but be-
ing not long after scized with a violent distemper‚ she told her husband the
dream,”and appeased the wrath of the goddess, by promising to build the
temple : as soon as she recovered, she was accordingly sent by him to Hie-
rapolis, and with her a large. sum of money, and a numerous army, who
