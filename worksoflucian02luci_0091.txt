ADIALOGUE.

The Empreſs, whom LUCIAN had sb highly c07742‘2ll7nented in the Portrait, not lik-

traordinatjy Praiſs’s, having stgnzfled to his Friend her Di approbatimz, the Amor
enters here into a serious Defence of his Encomium, amlfiipports it with some
Reaspning, anda great deal qs Politeneſs. It is, indeed, full of as court& and

POLYSTRATUS.

AM obliged to Lycinus, said the Lady, for his commendations, as ie

shewed his affe<ffion and respe& for me3 no man could be so lavish of his
praises withoutsome real: regard: but 1 would have him know I hate flat-

a kettle ofmedicated herbe, and' boiled him till he became young again: such extraordinary‘
success, in a proje& so universally de firable, put the daughter of Pelias, tyram of Iolchos, on
requesting the same favour of her for their father: she accordingly dipped him also in her caul-

again. See the story told at full length by Ovid,
