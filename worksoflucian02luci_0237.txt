lieve this, we are in imminent danger ; our tcmplcs will have no garlands,
our cups will be empty, and our altars cold3 we shall baveno victims or sa-
crifices, and famine must ensue: in the mean time, l stand like the captain
of the veffel, with the rudder in my hand, the mariners all drunk, or fast
asseep, and only myselfawake day and night without food or 1·est;

⁷* My heart is full of sorrow, grief, and care,

And alll have for it is, the honour of being called Lord and Maste-r. Ι
would fain alk these philosophers who talk so much of our happiness, what
time they think we can have to enjoy our neetar and ambrosia, with so
much bufiness on our hands: for want of leisure, I have now by me, I know
not how many old books of causes, covered with rust and spider's webs,
particularly between the profeffors of arts and sciences, which I have never
been able to settle; these they are always calling upon me to decide, accufing
me of ssoth and indolence, not knowing that the delay is occafioned not by
neglect, but by that state of felicity which l am supposed to live in; sor so

they chuse to— call my perpetual hurry and fatigue.

whisper together, accufing you of delay, when they ought to be thoroughly

satisfied. ‘⁴

What is to be done then, Mercury ; shall we give them a hearing nOW, or

put it off till next year?

O by no means3 let us have it immediately.

Be it so then: do you ley down, and give out, that “ whoever has any

cause to try, must come forth to the Armpagus, Justice shall there appoint
proper judges to determine ;Α but if any one shall think himself aggrieved by

the sentence, he may appeal to me, and 1 will rejudge the cause.'' Go you,
my 1 daughter, as affess'or to the ’,1, venerable goddesses, and preside over

the⁴ court.
