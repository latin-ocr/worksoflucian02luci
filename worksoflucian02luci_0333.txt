machine come down for my affistance. Cleodemus rose up to meet him,
and as soon as he was seated, he made some cnquiries concernirg the hcalrh
ofEucnmes, who informed him ‘that he was now much bctrt-r; after which,
addreffing himself to the company, “ On what point, said hc, were you
philosophifing? for you seemed, as Icame in, to bein high dispute.⁷’ ‘⁶ VVe
were only, says Eucrates, endeavouring to persuade this picco of adamant
here, pointing to me, that there were such things as ghosts and spectre53
and that after death men frequently came upon earth, and appeared to
whom they pleased.” Iblulhed, and looked down, for sear of Arignotus.
‘⁸‘ Perhaps, said he, Tychiades thinks that none wander about in this man-
ner, but the souls of those who have died violent deaths, been hanged‚ bc-
headed, or such like, and not those who quit this life in the natural and
common way; and if this be his opinion, it is not altogether to be rejected?
“ No such thing, replied Dinomachus, he absolutely denies that any ever
can, or did appear.” “ What say you, cried Arignotus,¹ looking sternly at
me, can you really deny this, when every body, as 1 may say, has seen
thern ?'' “ Yon have apologized for me, replied‘ Ι, because 1 am the only
one who did not: if t had seer-1· them, Ι should then have believed, as you
d0.” “ When you come next to Corinth, said Arignotus, ask for the house
of Eubatidas, at the ³¹⁵ Cranaeum, and when-they fhew it you, tell Tibius,
the portet, that you· want to see the spot from whence Arignotus drove out
the spirit, by digging up the'earth, and made the house habitable from that
day forward.” ‘¹‘ How was that, interrupted Eucrates? let us knOW, I
beseech you.''' ‘⁶ Thus, replied he, it was: this house had been for a
long time deserted on account of spectres 3⁴ and if any body went into it, he
was soon driven out again by a terrible and noisy apparition‚ till at length the
whole tenement began to d'ecay, and moulder into ruins„ and no body would
venture tov go near it. I= heard of this, and taking with me some certain
books (for rhad several AEgyptian traets by me on the subject), 1 entered
the house early in the evening, though my landlord endeavoured to diffuade
me from it, and even by main violence would have held me back, as satis-
fied that I was rushing on inevitable destruction. 1 took a candle, however,
went in alone, and feating myself on the ground, in the largest chamber,

what manner the ancient scenery was conduned, we have no particular account, at least none to
bedepended on. The curious reader, however, may find some inaccurate descriptions ot* this*

kind in Julius Pollux.
