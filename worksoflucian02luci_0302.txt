296 ΟΝ MOURNING Fon 'ruz DEAD.

there is the lake ‘²‘ Acheron, that receives the new inhabitants, and which
cannot be passed without a serry-man, too deep to go through on feet, and
too wide to swim over; even the dead birds cannot fly so far. At the gare,
which is of adamant, sits ἦν AEacus, the king’s brother's son, who guards it;
and near him stands the ἶ three-headed dog, a most fierce beast‚ who welcomes
the guests with a mild and placid countenance‚ but if they endeavour to
escape, makes a most dreadful howling. ‘After paffing this lake, they are re-
ceived into a large meadow, planted with asphodelus, and drink the liquor of
oblivion, which dessroys the memory, and is therefore called ΙΙ Lethe: so we
are told by those who returned from thence, Alcestes, Protesilaus, Theffalus,
Theseus the son of AEgeus, and Homer's Ulyffes, most grave and creditable
witneffes, and who, 1 suppose, never drank of that same water, or they
could not so well have remembered it. There, they tell υς, Pluto and Pro-
serpine reign, and govern all things·, with thern exercise dominion also, a
large multitude of Furies, Terrors, and Punissitnents, with § Mercury at their
head, though he is not always amongst them. As magistrates, satraps, or
judges, fit Minos and Rhadmanthus, two Cretans, and sons of Jupiter3
these, when they get together a few good and honest rnen, w'no have lived
virtuoussy, send thern off to establish a colony in the Elyfian fields, where
rhey live a life osjoy and happiness. On the other hand, when they lay
hold on the wicked, they deliver them over to the Furies to be punished for
their iniquities‚ in the regions of sorrow3 there they suffer most grievoussy3
some are to1tured, others burned, torn by vulturs, fixed on wheels, or roll-
ling stones up hill; Tantalus standing at the lake, and dying with thirst;

i* ⁴Ean-us] Son ofJupiter and .Egina, he was king of Oenopia, which he called AEgina, in
honour of his mother-3 he was so renowned for equity that the poets thought proper to reward
him, by reserving a place for him between Minos and Rhadamanthus, the two chiefjustices of

hell.
g Three-lmded dag] Cerberus.

ξ Laba] Which in Greek fignifies oblivion. The properties attributed to this water, fur-
nished a late ingenious writer, whom we cannot sufficiently lanient, with the subject of his ex·
cellen: dratnatic satire.

ῃ Merum—y] whose busmess it was to conclu& the departed mortals to the Ihades, leave thern
there, and immediately return to earth for another car-go. His stay, therefore, as Lucian ob-
serves, could be but {hort amongst them.
