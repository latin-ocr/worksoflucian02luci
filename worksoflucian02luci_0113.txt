1 believe so : but proceed we now to my fourth instance, Zenothemis of
Masfilia, the son of Charmoleus. He was shewn to me in Italy, when 1 was
on a public embaffy there3 a tall, handsome young man, and, as they in-
formed me, very rich3 in the chariot by him sat a woman, extremely ugly‚
and deformed, her right fide shrunk up and withered, with only one eye, in
short, a perse& '⁴⁵ fright: on expreffingmy surprize, that a youth so beauti-
ful should have such 3 woman with him, the man who shewed them to me,
and who was himself a Maffilian, explained the affair to me, which he was
perfe&ly acquainted with: Zenothemis, said he, was the intimate friend of
Menecrates, father to that ugly woman; they were both, indeed, of equal
rank and fortune, it happened, however, that, on a certain occasion, Me-
necrates was at once deprived of all his riches, and stripped of his honours
and dignities by the ἢ* fix hundred senators, for giving sentence contrary to
1aw; for so we punish offenders of this kind in Massylia ε the unhappy man
was deeply affected at being thus reduced from affluence to penury, from
honour and reputation to infamy and disgrace3 but what gave him the
greatest uneafiness was this daughter, now marriageablc, being about two
and twenty, whom before this, rich as her father then was, nobody‚ even of
the lowest rank or condition, chose to marry, so ‡ unhappy was her form
and appearance ς besides, that stre was subje& to falling fits‚ at the increase
of the moon.

As he was one day lamenting these misfortunes to his friend Menecrates,
said Zenothemis to him, “ Be comforted, you {han never want, and your
daughter shall marry a man of family equal to her own.” Saying this, he
took Menecrates by the hand, carried him home with him, and gave him an
equal strare of his fortune, which was very confiderable; ordered a splendid
entertainment to be got ready, to which Menecrates, with other friends¹>
were invited ς’ intimating, that he had procured a husband for his daughter.
When they had supped‚ and made a libation to the gods, he took a bow}
