lytris, and make him odious in the fight of his father, though he had done
nothing wicked or reprehenfible.

But sometimes it will be said, the calumniator is worthy of credit and
should be attended to, when he is, in other respects, a man of charaCter,
justice, and wisdom ; we ought to listen to those, who are, themselves, in-
capable of doing evil. But, who was morejust than Aristides? and yet even
he conspired against Themistocles, and stirred up the people against him,
urged by the same popular ambition as his rival whom he persecuted. Ari-
stides, compared with others, might deserve the name of *Just, but Aristides
was still a man, harboured anger and resentment, and loved and hated like
other men. Palamedes, if we give credit to what is reported of him, though
one of the wisest of the Greeks, and in other respe&s the best of men, was
detected of a base and malicious defign against a near † relation and friend,
who had accompanied him in his dangerous voyage. So natural is it to all
mankind to err in this particular.

What shall we say of Socrates, who was unjustly accused to the Athenians
of impiety and defigns against the state? or of Themistocles and Miltiades,
who, after so many glorious vietories, were calumniated as betrayers of their
country? with innumerable other examples, most of them too well known
to be disputed, or called in question.

How then is a wise man to aec, when doubts arise concerning truth and
virtue? that, no doubt, which Homer intimates to us in his fable of the
SyrenS, when he commands them to pass by those dangerous pleafing de·
cdvers, and shut their ears against them; to appoint reason as our watchful
door-keeper, to mark every thing that is said, to admit what is worthy to be
admitted, to keep out and expel that which is bad and unworthy: for how
absurd is it, to set door-keepers at our houses, and, at the same time, leave
our ears and our heatts open to every intruder!

XVhen such things, therefore, are said, we ought, <ourse1ves, carefully to
examine into the saer, without regard to the age, the character, or the en·

is flatly contradicted ; and yet, if it were not sc, my author must be guilty himself of the very
vice he is declaiming against.

blame than Palamedes.
