There remains nothing now to crown the whole, but the speech of Chari-

demus, which I must beg him to repeat.
CHARIDEMUS.

I beseech you, Hermippus, do not ask me to go any farther: Ι meant
only to tell you what they said ; besides, that I really cannot recolle& all that
Ι advanced on the occafi0n; it is eafier to remember other people’s speeches

than one's own.
H E R M I P P U S.

But 1 did not want so much to hear their’s as your’s3 this was my aim
from the beginning, and if you refuse me, all you have done hitherto is toz
no purpose; l beg, therefore, you will let me have the whole speech as you

promised.
' CHARIDEMUS.

You had better spate me, and be content with what you have; however,
as you are so extremely defirous of hearing my speech, thus it was :

“ Hadl been the first speaker in praise of beauty, I should undoubtedly
have stood in need of aa exordium3 but as Ι come after others, I may con-
fider what thcy have advanced in their speeches as a kind.0f prooemium to
mine3 especially, as they are all made at the same time and place, so that
they may pass for one continued oration, of which each takes a separate
part: what you have already said might be praise sufficient for any other
thing, but on this subjeet there must always remain enough unsaid, to employ
the tongues of those who come after us; it will still afford various topics‚
as in a fertile meadow, there are always fresh flowers to attra& the eye of the
t-raveller‚ 1 will endeavour, therefore, to select such arguments as may best
illustrate it, and speak as briefly as poffible in praise'of beauty.
