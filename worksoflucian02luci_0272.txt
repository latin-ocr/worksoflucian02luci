265 TuzPARASITE.

S 1 M Ο.

To stop your admiration, and convince you that it is no jesting matter,
let us but for a moment suppose word was just now brought, that the enemy
had invaded this country, that we could no longer suffer him to lay waste
our lands, but were under the immediate neceffity of taking up arms against
him; that our commanders had summoned all to the field who were of age to
fight, and, among the rest, the philosophers, rhetoricians‚ and parafites
were gathered together: first, then, let us sce them naked, for they must be
stripped before they put down their arms; observe the men one by one, and
examine their bodies; you will find some of them pale, thin, and emaciated‚
as if they had been left half dead on the field of battle, how ridiculous it is
to imagine, that such poor wretches as these could ever be fit for a close en-

on the outfide of the walls, or if they were ever forced into an engagement,
they were sure to quit their ranks and run away.

Yet soit is, and 1 will prove it; amongst your orators, how did isocrates

behave l so far was he from going out to battle, that he was afraid even to
ascend the rostrum, but lost his voice in the fright. In the war with Philip,

did not Demades, AEschines, and Philocrates give up themselves and their

country through fear to the invader; did not they stay at home on purpose
to manage his affairs with the commonwealth, and were not all those who

took his part ranked amongst their best friends? even Hyperides, Lycurgus,
