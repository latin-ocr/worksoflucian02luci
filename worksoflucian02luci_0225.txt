ICARO-MENIPPUS. ²²9

fister3 Lyfimachus betrayed by his ³< son3 Antiochus intriguing with his
† mother-in-law; Alexander the Theffalian, ssain by his wisc 3 ᾗ] Antigonus
in adultery with his daughter-in·law; and Attalus poisoned by his son: in
another place, I saw Arsaces killing his wife, and the eunuch Arbaces draw-
ing his sword upon Arsaces3 Spartim, the Mede, dragged by the hecls s oin
the banquet by his guards‚ and knocked o’ the head with a cup. In the,
palaces of Scythia and Thrace, the same wickedness was going forward3 and
nothing could I see but murrherem, adusterers, conspirators, ravishers, fam:-
swearers‚ men in perpetual terrors, and betrayed by their dearest friends and

acquaintance.
Such was the employment of kings and great men ε in private houses there

was something more ridiculous·, there Ι saw Hermodorus the Epicurean
forswearing himself for a thousand drachmas3 Agathocles the Stoic quar-
reling with his disciples about the salary for tuition ; Clinias the orator steal-
ing a phial out of the temple ; and Herophilus the Cynic sseeping in a bawdy—
house: not to mention a thousand others, who were undermining w.ills‚ liti-
gasting in the forum, extorting money, or lending it upon usury; a sight,
upon the whole, of wonderful variety.

I had much ado to see, to relate it to you is impoffible3 it was like Ho-
mer’s § ffiield, on one fide were feasting and nuptials, on the other har-
ranguing and decrees; here a sacrifice, and there a buria13 the Gerre at
war, the Scythians travelling in their caravans, the AEgyptians tilling their
fields, the Phoenicians merchandizing, the Cilicians robbing and plundering,
the Spartans flogging their children, and the Athenians perpetually quarrel-
ing and going to law with one another.

When all this was doing, at the same time, you may conceive what a
strange medley this appeared to me; it was just as isa number of dancers, or

ζ Antfigonus] Ido not remember to have met with this story in any author, nor can the com-
mentatore inform us who this Antigonus was; two or three other private histories are here allud-
ed 10, which, at this distance of time, we are unacquainted with, though the facts were probably
at that time well known, and remembered by every body.
