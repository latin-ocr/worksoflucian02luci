JUPITERTiiE TRAGEDIAN. ¹75

as the comedian says, and call a* boat a boat3 if things are so, I shall take
my leave of your honours and dignities here, your incense, and sacrifices,
and go down to hell, where, ifI carry but a bow without arrows, the shades,

at least, of the beasts I have ssain will be afraid of me.

JUPITER.

Oho! you are a † horne-witness, as they say, indeed3 you have fore-
stalled Darnis, by talking thus yourself: but who is this brazen figure coni-
ing in such haste towards us, with his hair tied back in the old fashion Ρ even
your brother of the forum, Mercury, he who stands near the Poecile; he is
all over ᾗ· pitch, fron] being handled every day by the statuaries. Why in
sucha hurry, son, have you any news for us from below ?

H E R M A G Ο R A S.
Very-great indeed, and such as require all haste and diligence.

J U P 1 ‘r E R.
What! any new disturbance ?

HERMAGORAS.

As back and breast with pitch well cover'd on

I stood, as oft accustom'd‚ the rude artist

His aukward corsset fasten’d round rne, when,
Behold! a crowd approach’d; amongst thern two
Pale clam’rous sophists in loud diffonance,

1 A barm] We always say, “ 1 calla spade, a spade.’⁷ Every rinnon, as 1 observed, in a foranei·
note, has a different manner of expreffing this sentiment. 1 chose to preserve the original idea,

ξ Abona-witneſs] In the Grecian conrrs os justice there were two soris ofevidences, the
first of which was called μαξτυρκι, when the person, or horne-witness, who swore, was an eye-
witness of the fad‘t3 the other went by the name of εκμαρτυρια, when thejnror received what he
testified from another person who had seen it; allegations, however, from absent persons were
seldom taken for lawful evidence. The witness'es always wrote down their testimony on athlete,
but the tablets of those who came from home to deliver their testimonies were different from
those of the witneffes who came casually into court. This may suffice to explain to the reader
the appellation of a home-witness, as applied to Hercules. See Potter.

ξ Pitch.] This famousbrazen statue of Mei-cury, so frequently mentioned by the ancienne,
was considered, like our Venus of Medicis, as a standard of perfeftion, the statuar-ies, there-
fore, were perpetually taking models of it, which, we suppose, they did by encrnliing the
whole over with a inould of pitch, or moist clay, and so procuring an exe& resemblance os it.
The ideaof a god, in this dirty condition, running up on an errand to heaven, and ad-
dressing Jupiter in heroics, has something trnly langhable in it.
