left, down you rumble. He will then order you to imitatcthe ancientq,
which is not very easy to do, and produce you some obsolete examples out
of the old shop, such as ³¹* Crates, ψ Hegesias, and the famous '4¹' issander, stiff
and laboured things, mighty accurate and exact. He will inform you.
perhaps, that industry, watchfulness, water-drinking, strigaliry, and so
forth, are indispenfible‚ as without them you can never travel that road. But
what is the most disagreeable of all, is, that it will eost you so much time,
not days or months, but years, nay, whole Olympiads, so that before hals
your tan< is over, you will fink under the toil, and in despair, bid a long
‚adieu to all your hoped-for happiness : add to this, that he will himself ex-
pec} no little reward, nor will he condescend to be your guide, unless you
bribe him handsomely before-hand. This insolent old Saturnian, who pro-
poses his ancient models, and wants you to rake up things long since buried
in oblivion; will advise you, as a great and mighty matter, to rival the

⁸ Crates] Is mentioned by Diogenes Laertius as a celebrated orator. The crines, however,
seem to think, that Lucian meant in this place, to speak of Critias, the famous orator, men·
tioned by Cicero, in his Treatise de Claris Oratoribus, who lived in the time of Thucydides ;
and who is likewise taken notice of by Philostratus, in his book de Vitis Sophistarum.

† Hegesian] Cicero speaks likewise, but seems to have entertained no very high opinion of
him, observing in the above mentioned treatise, de Clar. Orat. that Charisii voluit similis effe,

atque se ita putavit Atticum, ut viros illos prae se pene agrestes putaret.

ξ [flandren] Gorgias Leontinus, called the Issander, from his being a native of Sicily, which
was termed the issand Κατέξοχηη he was a disciple of Empedocles, and held the first rank
amongst the sophists of his time3 he is mentioned likewise by Philostratus and Plutarch.

Η Ακνοηιειεπ] AEschines, the famous orator. See Demosthenes‘s Oratio de Corona.
