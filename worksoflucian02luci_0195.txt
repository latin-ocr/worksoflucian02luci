THECOCKAND Tne COBLER. 189

belides, Iam a companion of ¹³² Mercury’S, that most talkative, most clo-
quent of allthe deities, and have lived so long with you, that is no wonder
Ι should have learned your language : but, ifyou will promise mc inviolable
secrecy, Iwill tell you how it came to pass that 1 am thus able to converse

'withyou0
‘MICYLLUS.

Surely this is all a dream, it can never he a Cock that is talking to me :
but, by Mercury, 1 besecch thee, explain it to me: you need not fear that
Issrould tellwhat you say, for, ifl did, who would believe me ?

C Ο C K.
Listen then, and you {hall hear3 what 1 am going to say is, to be sure, ra-

ther extraordinary: he who now appears before you as a Cocl<, was, not

long fince, a man.

I have formerly heard something of this kind, that a young man, of the
name of ἡ» Gallus, was the companion and intimate friend of Mars, used to
eat and drink with him, and be the confident in his amours: whenever the
god went to Venus he carried Gallus along with him, and srrspe&i1ig that
. the Sun might reveal the affair to Vulcan, posted the young man at the door

to give him notice when Phoebus appeared; but Gallus unfortunately be-
trayed his trust, and fell asseep3 when the sun came unexpe&edly upon the
lovers, who had relied upon the notice which the youth had promised to give
them, and informed Vulcan of it, who seized upon, and bound them with

the chains he had prepared. As soon as Mars got out, he was highly en-
raged at Gallus, and turned him into a bird of the same name, who bears a
erest on his forehead, instead of the helmet which he wore: for this reason

— Heav’n gave signs of wuith—along the ground

Crept the rtiw hides, :md with a bellowing sound‚

Roar’d the dead limbs, the burning entrails groan'd.

See Pope⁷s Homer's Odysi'ey‚ book xii. l. 464.
This fiffion of Homer’sis7 to be sure, a pretty bold one; Lucian has made the most of it, by
telling us, that the oxen lowed upon the spir. The ridicule is at least as strong as the absur-
dity.
³? Mercuty’s.] Mercury is always represented with a coel< close to him, as an emblem of vi-

gilance, he being considered as the most affive and industrious of all the deities: he had, in· υ
deed, more business to do than any of them.

† Gallus] This is a curious fabie, and if cloathed in a poetical dress, would have made no
inconsiderable figure in Ovid’s Metamorphoses ; it is a wonder, indeed, how, if the story was
generally known, it happened to escape him. A young hard, ambitious os shooting with the
Ovidian bow, could not, perhaps„ choose a more promising subjeet.
