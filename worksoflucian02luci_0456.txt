450 TneFUGITIVES.

Being at length contradicted and confuted by my disciples, they began to
grow warm, and to combine against them, to accuse them in the forum, and
conlign them to chains and hemlock. lought, perhaps, to have quitted
them immediately, and no longer to have associated with such men z but An-
tisthenes and Diogenes, and after them Crates and Menippus, persuaded me
to stay a little longer3 would 1 had not done it! I should not then have suf-

You have not yet told me what those indignities were.

Listen then, and 1 will inform you: there is a low set of men, servile,

mean, and mercenary‚ who never had, in their youth, any converse or com-
munion with me, but were either servantS‚ tradesmen, ’ἓ coblers, smiths,
fullers, preparers of wool for the women, or engaged in some handicraft or
other of this kind, and consequently from their childhood scarce ever so
much as heard of my name: but, finding, when they were advanced in life,
that my followers met with universal esteem and admiration, that rnen put
confidence in them, obeyed their dietates, and dreaded their censure; all
this, they thought, was very defirable, and seemed to establish a little em—

indeed, totally imprafficable. ln the mean time, little was got by the arts
they professed, and they had much ado, with all their labour, to support
themselves. Servitude was a heavy burthen, and to many of thern grew in·
tolerable. Compelled by these difficulties, they resolved to cast, what the
sailors call, their sacred anchor, and moor their ship in my har-bour ι and to
this end, they called in lgnorance and Impudence for their allies, with Ca-

dialogue will be extremely applicable, from beginning to end, to the enthufiasts of the present
age. Our Methodists are, with respe& to the regular clergy, exaffly what Lucian’s sophisss
were when compared to the true phihsophers, composed, like them, of the lowest orders
amongst us, proud, impudent, ignorant, and inimare, resembling, above all, their Grecian
gredecessors, iu laying heavy contributions on all their deluded followerS.
