But waq never intended for both. A inan may make use of a pot to

drink out of instead of a cup, though it was certainly never made for that
purpose. It is impossible, in short, to relate all the folly and misery of
these people3 and yet, because I will not fide with them, you find fault
with me : in the mean time, 1 live in an humble state, eat whatever hap-
pens to come before me, and wear what Ι can get cheapest, without ever
wishing to taste of their dainties; and because both my defires and my wants
are moderate, you say I live like a beast. According to your way of rca-
soning, the gods themselves are worse than beasts3 for they want nothing :¹
but, that you mayjudgc which is most eligible, to stand in need of many
things, or of a few only, remember, that children want more than adults,
women more than men, and the fick more than those in health 3 the infe-
rior has always more neceffities to supply than the superior. The gods have
no wants, and those who approach nearest to thern, but very few. Do you
imagine that Hercules, that noble hero, who is deservedly honoured and
revered as a god, was forced by neceffity to wander about naked, *or only
with a 1k'm to cover him, or that he wished for any of those things which
you indulge yourselves in? He could not himself be wretched who freed
others from misery; or poor, who commanded earth and sea: wherever
his valour led him, he was sure to conquer, and met with none superior,
none equal to himself. Do you think he thus wandered about the world
because he wanted ssaoes and-cloaths Ρ you cannot suppose it. But he was
temperate, patient, and long-suffering: he wished to conquer, and would
. not therefore be unnervcd by luxury.

Was not his follower, Theseus, the king of all the Athenians‚ and son
of Neptune, one of the bravest of men? and yet he also went naked and
barefoot‚ and wore a long beard: and this custom was observed, not by
him only, but by all our ancestoi·5‚ who were better rnen than you. They
were never ssiaved any more than lions. They, no doubt, thought a soft
or smooth {kin became women only ; but, as they were men, they wished
to appear as such. They lookcd upon the beard as an ornament to man,
as the mane to horses, and a beard to lions, and which God bestowed on
those creatures as a beauty and perfection. The ancients‚ therefore, l ad-
mire and imitate ι and as to those of the present age, 1 envy them not the

hap.
