440 ΟΝ THE DEATH OF PEREGRINUS.

followed him, some will tell us, that this daemon of the night appeared to
them, and cured them of their agnes. His disciples‚ I suppose, will set
up an maele, and build a temple on the spot where he perished, especially,
as the first Proteus, the son os Jove, was a prophet ε he will have his priests
ῑοο, 1 imagine, by and by, who will whip or burn themselves like their
master, have their nocturnal rites, and carry their torches round his funeral
pile.

Theagenes‚ as one of his cornpanions informed me, lately gave out
that a 811))1 had already prophe-fied concerning these things, in the following
verses.

When Proteus, glory of the Cynic name,
Shall bnilrl his pile, and leap into the flame:
When he ssmll reach the starry realrns above,
And high Olyinpus' top, the seat of Jove:

Then, mortals all, let night’s protecting lord,
With Hercules and Vulcan, be ador’d.

Theagenes said, he received these from the Sibyl herself. Ι shall now give
you the oracle of ἥ Bacis on the sarne subject ; it speaks thus:

Is known, incited by that fury, Fame,

Shall leap into the fire, the whelps, who wait
Around the wolf, shall meet their master's fate.
if one amongst thern {hun the glorious fire,

To stone the coward let all Greece conspire:

That none may boast of heat who stxake with cold,
Or fill their coffers with ill· -gotten gold.

What think you, my friends, is not Bacis as good a prophet as the Sibyl?
The noble followers of Proteus have nothing to do bnt look out for a pro-

phrase for burning.

’θ Bacis] Though‚ compared with the Sybilline, this was but a kind of second-rate oracle,
it had its day. Some of its most notable predifiions are mentioned by Herodotus and Pausa·
nias: Lucian, however, has made very free with it. This is apparently a fiffion of his own,
written on purpose to ridicule the other, and is no bad burlesque of it.
