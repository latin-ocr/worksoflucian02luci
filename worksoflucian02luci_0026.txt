20 ALEXANDEmoa,

In Ister's sacred stream, 'tis my command,
Ye plunge two mountain lions, like to those
Who draw the car of Cybele, with flowers‚
And fragrant herbs, that scent the Indian air;
This leads to glory, νἰξὶοῐγ, and peace.

This being done, according to his command, the lions swam on shore in the
enemies country, and were killed with ssaves by the Barbarians, like dogs,
or foreign wolve33 soon after we received a desperate ·4’ wound, scarce less,
than twenty thousand of our forces being cut 0ff; then followed also, what

happened at Aquileia, when the city was very near being taken. Alexander,
in order to palliate the event, had recourse to the old Delphic defence, and
very cooly applied the oracle of Craesus, saying, that the god had, indeed,
foretold a νἰέὶοῑγ, but did not declare whether it would fall to the Romans
or to their enemies.

Numbers at length flocking into the city, on account of the oracle, it
became so full that the people were in want of neceffaries3 at this time it
was that he set up what he called the night-oracles; for, receiving the books
over night, he ssept upon them, and gave his answers in the morning, as if
revealed to him by the god in a dream : these were not plain and clear, but
most of them obscure and unintelligible3 especially if he observed that the
book was scaled up with more than ordinary care: for not venturing to open
it, he wrote in answer just what came into his head, as thinking this was best
suited to the nature of oracles ; to explain these, certain interpreters were ap·
pointed, who received no small reward for it from those to whom the oraclo

was explained: their office, however was tributary, for every one of them
paid Alexander an Attic talent.

Sometimes, when nobody either came or sent to him, he would pour forth,
oracles of his own accord, merely to surprise and astonish the multitude: of
this nature was the following,

W'oud’st thou discover hirn who hath defiled
Thy nuptial bed ‚³-It is Protogenes, ,
Thy servant, he in whom thou dost confide:
Thou gav'st him all, and thus doth he return
The obligation : that thou may'st not see
