272 TnnPARASITE.

quet, he always frequents, and is the great ornament and conductor of them.
ln the palaestra, what orator or philosopher ean be compared with him for
shape and beauty, which of them is not rather a disgrace to the gymnasium
whenever he appears in it? If one of them meets a wild beast in the desan,
he is frightened out of his wits at him3 whilst our parafite sustains his attack
with the greatest ease and indifference ι by the frequent view of his adversary
on a ’ἦ table, he has learned to despise him ; no stag nor horrid boar affrights
our her0; for if the boar whets his teeth against him, he, in return, whets
his teeth against the boar: as to hares, he is fonder of running after them
than the dogs themselves: at a feast, whether eating or jesting, who is able
to contend with him? who can so well entertain the company, he who is
for ever fingirg and cutting jokes, or the poor creature who lies down in his
short cloak, never smiles, but looks upon the ground, with a melancholy
countenance, as if he came to a funeral instead of a banquet; a philosopher
at a feast, I think, is like a † dog in a bath.

But, to pass over these matters, let us come at once to the life of the parasite,
and compare it with theirs. ln the first place then, he has an utter contempt
of all fame and glmy, and never cares what people think of him 3 now your
orators and philosophers, one and all of them, are fond of both, and
what is worse, of money too ·‚ whilst the parasite values it no more than the
sand upon the sea-shore, and thinks it as bad as fire. Our rhetoricians, and
what is more ssmmeful, those who call themselves philosophers‚ are so at-
tached to their interest, that amongst them, (for as to the orators‚ I shall ’
take no notice of them,) some in the courts of judicature have taken bribes,
others exa& money from their pupils,·others without a blush, will ask a
ssipend os a king for living with him. You may see many an old fellow
ranibling about, and letting himself out, like Indian and Scythian ssaves,
nor is he assiamed to own that he receives wages: besides all this, you will,
find them subject to melancholy, to anger, envy, to paffions, appetites, and
defires os every kind; ‘but the parafite is free srom all : he is never angry,
first, because he can bear misfortunes, and secondly, because there ἰέ nobody
whom he can be angry with3 if at any time he is a little ruffled, his resent-
