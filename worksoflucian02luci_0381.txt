APoPHRAs. 375

things of you, that well deserve the severest iambics : even such, as but to
paint one of them, would be too hard a task for Archilochus, with Simon-
ides and ’λθ Hipponax to affist hirn ε as a subjcet for satire, ἦ* Orodaecides,
Lycambes, and Bupalus, are but boys to you. Surely some malicious
daemon must have taught you thus to laugh at my ignorance‚ and expose
your own, by proving yourself a stranger even to the most common things
which every body is acquainted with, and subjedting yourself to the ridicule
ofa free-speaker, as Iam3 one who knows you so intimately‚ andis not
afraid of divulging it, but rather would wilh to proclairn publicly every thing
youthave done, and every thing you are still doing, from morning to night.
Vain, however, and superfluous will be the task, to school you as one would
doa man of an ingenuous and liberal mind, fince you will never be the better
for repr00f3 but, like the l beetle, still continue to wallow in the filth you
are used to: every body knows what you are, and how long you have been
so. You have not finned so secretly‚ nor so securely, but that all may easily
discover the ass, without taking off the lion’s skin; and he must come far
§ north, indeed, or bea perse& Η Cumaean, who does not find you out before
you bray. The public, as well as myself, is too well acquainted with your
life and manners ε your chara&er is worse than that of *l* Ariphrades‚ η’ Mis-
thon the Sybari-ite, or even ³⁵* Bastas the Chian, so famous for vices of the
farne kind. Trite, however, and obsolete as the subjee'c is, I cannot pass it

⁴¹· Hipponax] This dreadful satiust, who it seems was the Churchill of his age, wrote some-
thing so severe against a painter that, we are told, he took it to beart, and hanged himself.
