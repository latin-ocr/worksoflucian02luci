and Thyestes, EEropesshe golden fleece, the wedding of Pelops, the murther
of Agamemnon, and the punishment of Clytemnaestra3 before this, the ex—
pedition of the seven leaders against Thebes, the reception of the banilhed
sons—in-law of Adrastus, the oracle concerning them, the forbidding of fune-
ral sites, and the-deaths of Menaeceus and Antigone in consequence of it;
add to this, as necefl'ary to be known, what happened in Nemaea, to Hyp-
sipyle and Archemorus, and what pass‘ed long before that with relation to
Danae's prison, the birth of Perseus, and his combat with the Gorgon, to
which is joined the history of AEthiopia‚ Caffiopeia, Andromeda, and'Ce-
pheus, whom the credulity of after—ages placed amongst the stars: neither
must he forget the story of Danaus and AEgyptus, and the fradulent marriage
of their children. Laeedaemon will also furnissi him with many events, the
loves of Hyacinthus, the rivalship of Zephyrus and Apollo, the murthcr of
the boy by a disens, the flower that sprung up from his blood with the me·
lancholy marks upon it, Tyndarus rising from the dead, and Jupiter's quar-
rel with AEsculapius, the wandering of Paris after his judgment of the apple,
with therape of Helen. The history of Troy is connected with that of Sparta,
and is very large and comprehensive: as from almost every one of the adven-
tures there, a fable may be composed; all which, he ought, therefore, to
retain in his memory‚ particularly from the rape of Helen to the return of
the Greeks, the voyages of AEneas, and the paffion of Dido; with which
may be connected, the acts of Orestes, and what he performed in Scythia:
nor must the previous circumstances be forgot of Achilles remaining at Scy5
rus in the habit of a virgin, the madness of Uiyffes, Philoctetes left in the
desart issand, all the adventures of Ulyffes, Circe, and Telegonus, the power
of AEolus over the winde», and every thing that happened down to the death
of the suitors, back as far as the snares laid for Palamedes, the anger of
Nauplius, the madness of one Ajax, and the death of the other amongst the
rocks. Ifflis will also fur-nith the lkilful dancer with many subjeets ; Oeno-
maus, Myrtilus, Saturn, Jupiter, and the first contendere at the Olympic'
games. Arcadia will likewise supply him with abundance of fables, such as
the ssight of Daphne, Callisthes living the life of a savage, the drunken
frolics ofthe Centaurs, the birth of Pan, the loves of Alpheus, and his div·
Ε jug under the sea. If he paffes over into Crete, he will meet with great va-
riety, Europe, Pasiphae, the two bulls, the labyrinth‚ Ariadne, Phaedra,
AndrogeOS, Daedalus, Icarus, Glaucus, the prophecies of Polyides, and
