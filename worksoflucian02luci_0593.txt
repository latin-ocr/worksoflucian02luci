'rur-z GOUT-TRAGEDY.

With this my festive Bacchanalian tram,

Haste, and perform my dread commands; do thou,
With painful twinges pierce their tendet feet,

Seize thou the knotted wrist, and thou the hand ;

To you, my trusty agents, I¹commit

Their arms, joints, knees, and thighs; g0‚ bind them fast,

And torture with variety of pain.
T O R M E N T O R S.
Great queen, thy orders are obey'd: behold !
Yonder they lie, their agonizing limbs
Stretch'd on the ground, they groan beneath our torments.

How fares your med'cine now, My noble guests Ρ
If it succeeds, and can oppose my pow'r,
I bid adieu to earth ; henceforth conceal'd,
In the dark womb of Tartarus profound
Content to hide my ignominious head.
P H Y S Ῑ C I A Ν.
We have apply’d our ointment, but in vain :
For, oh ! I die, the fatal {haft swift runs
Through ev'ry vein : not the red bolt of Jove,
Nor the rough surge of the tempestuous sea,
Nor rapid whirlwind’s force, can equal thine3
'Tis the keen tooth of hungry Cerberus,
The viper’s poison, or ‘⁴‘ th'envenom'd {hirt
Of the feu Centaur: O! have mercy, pow'r
Invincible! no morta} remedy
Can mitigate thy pangs3 thou reign’st supreme
O’er all, and we, with all, confess thy sway.
“ G o D D E s s.
Cease, my tormentors, punish them no more;
They do repent, and we forgive: henceforth
Let mortals learn, that we alone defy
The pow’r of med'cioe, and unconquer’d still,
By human art, or human force, remain-

ἃ Th’invenom’d.] Nec munus humeris efficacis Herculis

Exarfit aestuofius. Hor.
