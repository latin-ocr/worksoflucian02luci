Stymphalus, the Thracian horses, or the drunken frolics of the Centaurs.
To say the truth‚ all we trouble ourselves about, is, to see that mortals sa-
crifice to us, and raise the smoke at our altars ; every thing else flows on in
its own channel, andjust as fortune may dire& it: itis not, therefore, [ο
be wondered at now, nor should it be hereafter‚ if men open their eyes,
and discover that it is of little service to them to sacrifice and make libations
to us. *Many an Epicurus, Metrodorus, and Darnis must you expe& to see,
laughing at, and despifing us, and our advocates subdued and destroyed by
them. Be it your’s, therefore, to appease these tumults, for you have raised
them: your’s to heal these wounds, for you have inffieted them. Momus runs
but little hazard of being deprived of his honours, for he has seldom met
with any, whilst you have all enjoyed your victims, and your worship.

Shall we, ye godS, suffer this madman to rave on thus, always severe 35
heis, and always abui-ive? Eut, as the excellent Demosthenes says, it is very
easy to censure, to calumniare, and find fault with things, and may be done
by any body who has a mind to it; but to advise well how they may be
mendecl, is the part of a good and prudent counsellor : and this, Itrust,
the rest of you will do, when he shall think proper to hold his tongue.

1, as you all very well know, live at the bottom of the sea, and take care of
things there, preserve mariners, save ships, and pacify the winds; at the same
time Ι am not indifferent about affairs here3 and my opinion is, that this
Darnis should be immediately taken off, before he enters again on this dis-
pute, either by lightning, or some other way, for fear he should get the bet-
ter; for you say he has the talent of persuafion: thus shall we shew mankind
that we know how to be revenged on those who declaim against us.

Surely, Neptune, you are in jest, or must have forgot that these things
are not in our power, and that the ἦ Fates alone determine whether a man
isto die by lightning, fever, sword, or pestilence: were it not s0‚ do you
think 1 would ever have suffered these sacrilegious wretches to have gone off

would not agree to set it down as one of the twelve labours to be imposed on him, because [ο-
laus affisted him in the conquest. The truth of this story is, that the marshes of Lerna were in-
fested with serpents, of which there seemed to beno end (like the Hydra’s heads), Hercules
drained the marffies, and got rid of them ; all the rest is poetical table,
