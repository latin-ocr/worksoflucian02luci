212 ICAROssMENIPPUS.

F R Ι Ε Ν D.

Thou art a bold rogue, indeed, and meant, no doubt, if you had chanced
to fall into any part of the ocean, to have called it, as * Icarus did, by
your own name, and styled it the Menippean Sea.

Not so; his wings were glued on with wax, and when the sun melted it,

could not escape falling3 but mine had no wax in them.

F R 1 E N D.
Indeed! now ss1a11 Ι quickly know the truth of this affair.

M E N 1 P P U S.
You shall: I took, you rnust knOW, avery large †eagle, and a vultur

its creator, the beginning, or the end of it. When Ι descended to its fleve-
ral parts, Iwas still more in the dark: 1 beheld the starS, scattered as it
were, by the hand of chance, over the heavens; Ι saw the sun, and wished
to know what it was x above all, the nature of the moon appeared to me
most wonderful and extraordinary 3 the diverfity of its forms pointed out some
hidden cause, which 1 could not account for3 the lightning also, which

pus’s is greatly 'unproved upon. For a humourous detail of the many advantages attending this
noble art, Irefer my readers to the Spectator.
