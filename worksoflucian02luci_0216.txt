MENIPPUS AND Α FRIEND.

MENIPPUS.

HREE thousand ⁹ stadia from the earth to the moon, rny first rest·
ing-place3 frorn thence up to the sun about five hundred parasanga;
and from the sun to the highest heaven, and the palace of Jupiter, as far

as a swift eagle could fly in a day.

FRIEND.

What are you muttering to yourself, Menippus, talking about the stars,
and pretending to measure distances? As I walk behind you, I hear of
nothing but suns, and moons, parasangas, stations, and I know not

what.
MENIPPUS.

Marvei not, my friend, ifI utter things aerial and sublime; for I am re-
counting the wonders of my late journey.

F R 1 E N D.
What ! tracing your road by the stars, as the ’ᾗ Phoenieians do!

³⁶ Stadia] The ancient Greek stadium is supposed to have contained an hundred and twenty-
five geometricalpnces‚ or fix hundred and twenty-five Roman feet, corresponding to our fur-
Iong. Eight stadia make a geometr-imi, or Italian mile; and twenty, according to Dacier, a .
French league. Itis observed‚ notwithstanding, by Guilletiere‚ a famous French writer, that
the stadium was only fix hundred Athenian feet, fix hundred and four English feet, or a hun—
dred and three geometrical paces.

The Greeks measured all their distances by stadia, which, after all we can discover concern-
ing thern, are different in different times and places.

† Phoeniciaa1s.] The Phoenicium, it is supposed, were the first failors‚ and steered their course
according to the appearance of the Παῖς.
