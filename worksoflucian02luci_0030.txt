⁸4 ALEXANDE5R402,

for ‘Rutilianuz he could not punish him, even if he had been found guilty
<of the greatest enormities. Ι was obliged therefore, of neeeffity to defist, as
it would have been madness to accuse him before ajudge so predetermined.

Amongst other instances of his audacity, what think you of his asking the
emperor to change the name of the wall ofAbonus, and to call it 4 Ionopo-
÷1is; and striking money with the representation of Glycon,on one fide, and
'himself on the other3 with the crown of his grand-father AEsculapius, and
the scythe of Persem, his progenitor by the mother's fide ?

He had published an oraele which foretold that he should live to the age

of a hundred and fifty, and then be *l* struck dead with lightning: but after
all made a most miserable end, dying before he was quite seventy, as became
theson of Podalirius; his foot and lower parts mortifying up to the groin:
besides that, he was almost eaten up with worms. At the time of his death,
they discovered that he was 1 bald, the pain obliging him to lay open his
head to the physicians to pour something upon it, which they could not do
v without taking ffhis Η peruke. Ι

Such was the catastrophe of the tragedy of Alexander: one would suppose
it to have been the work of providence, though it might poffibly so fall out
by mere chance. Very fitting it was, that the ceremonies after his death
should correspond with those of his life, and that a contentiori should ensue
sor the oracle. His brethren and accomplices, therefore, petitioned Rutili-
anus to determine which of them should be preferred to it, and adorned
with the sacerdotal robe, and prophetie crown. Amongst them was Paetus
the phyfician, an old man, and grey-headed; little did it become his grey
hairs, or his profeffi0n‚ to appear in such an affair. Rutilianus, however,
who was to decide it, sent them all away uncrowued, reserving the prophet's
place for him, at some more convenient opportunity.

I have sele&ed‚ my dear friend, these few remarks by way of effay, partly
to oblige you, my old acquaintance ancl companiong whom 1 admire, as
well for your wisdorn and love of truth, as for that softness and sweetness of
