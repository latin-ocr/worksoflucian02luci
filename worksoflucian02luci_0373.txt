OnCALUMNY. 367

men 1001< upon each other with prying eyes, and endeavour, like gladia-
tors, to fmd out some naked part of the body : every one ssrivcs to be first,

and therefore elbows andjostles his neighbour, always trying to supplant and
trip up the heels of the man who goes before him : in this struggle the good
and worthy is soon thrownour with ignominy, whilst he who is {killed in ilat-
tery, and such like evil arts, will always flouriss1. The affailant generally
succeeds : so true is ‘⁴⁵ Homer's observation.

Mars is ourcornrnon lord, alike to all,
And oft the victor triumphs but to fall.

When the contest is for things of consequence and value, many arrs are put
in practice against each other, amongst which the most expeditioris, as well as
the most dangerous and destrunffive, is calumny, which ariseth from the envy
of another’s happiness, and is itself attended with the most tragic and fatal
calamities; ro raise suspicions, however, is no small or easy talk, but re-
quires great care, art, and ingenuity3 the calumny would not wound so
deep if it was not well supported, nor could it prevail against trurh, which is
stronger than all things, unless many an alluring, probable and persuafive ar-
gument was made use of to betray the hearer.

The man who is in the highest honour, and therefore most exposed to
envy, is generally the objeet aimed at} against him all point their arrows,
looking upon him as the greatest obstacle and impedimeut; if he who is the
principal could be got the better of, and removed from the royal favour,
every one might then hope to succeed to it.

Just so doth *it happen in the public course3 for there the good racer, as
soon as he starts from the bar, pushes forward with all speed to the goal,

and, relying on the swiftness of his feet alone for the victory, he hurts no
’ one, plans no destruetive schemes against his rivals; whilst the ssow of soor,
who has no hopes os success, turns his mind to evil arm, and only thinks
how he may stop and detain the swifr courser, well l<nowing‚ that ifhe can·
not do this, ir is impoffible he should himself ever gain the victory& and
thus itis with regard to the friendfhip of the great3 he who has the first
place is always exposed to the treachery of others, and if he falls amongst
powerful enemies, is inevitably destroyed ; those are often careffecl and look-
ed upon as the best friends who can do the most hurt3 those who would

have their calum-ny firrnly believed never a& carelessy, but take their utmost
