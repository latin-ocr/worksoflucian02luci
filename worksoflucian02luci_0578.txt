charnis tojussice, to wisdom, and to valour; it is this which makes every
thing valuable, and without which it is mean and contemptible. What is
not beautiful we call base, as if, where beauty is not, there could be nothing
worthy of admiration. Those who serve tyrants we call flatterers; and those
alone who [noctise the good and beautiful do we· admire3 to these we give
the title ofthe lovers of industry‚ and beauty.

Since beauty‚ therefore, hath something in it so noble and divine, that it
is universally fought after, aud universally obeyed, should we not be highly
bhmeaffle, if we did not all endeavour to celebrate, to acquire, and to pre-
serve it ?’'

Thus did I speak concerning beauty‚ omitting a number of things which

might have been said, as the conversation was already drawn to so great a

length.

Happy were you, I think, to be present at such a one, and not less happy
have you made me by your relation of it.
