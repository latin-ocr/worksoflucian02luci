the dragon‚ with dreadful scales, and jaws gaping wide, and rnsliing upon
him. Perseus holds the Gorgon shield in his left hand, ansl in his right a
sword, with which he pierces one fide of the monster, whil‘il the other,
which is opposite to Medusa, is turned into stone.

Beyond this you see another picture expreffive of the divine justice: the
subje& of it seems to have been borrowed by the painter fron] Sophocles
or Euripides, who describe the circumstance in a manner very similar to it.
Two youths, Pylades the Phocian, and Orestes his friend, supposed to have
been dead some time, hide themselves in the smilace, and are represented in

the a& of killing AEgysshus. Clytemnestra, already ssain, lies on the bed
half·naked‚ the servants are standing round in the utmost confusion, some as
crying out, others looking round to see which way they can escape: the
painter has, with greatjudgtnent‚ shewn only what ought to be ssiewn, and
paffed over the representation of what had been before committam describ-
ing and dwelling on the murther ofthe adulterer. .

Next to these you may observe a † beautiful god, and a handsonie young
man: the piciure is a kind of love tale. Branchus fits upon a rock, with a
hare in his hand, which he holds outsto a dog, who is leaping up at it.
Apollo stands by, and seems delighted to sec the boy playing with the hare,

and the dog trying to catch it from him.
In another picture is Perseus again, with the dragon, Medusa's head

cut off, and Minerva defending the hero: he does not look, whilst he
performs the deed, on Medusa, except by the reflestion from his ffiield,
as well knowing how dear it would eost hini to fix his eyes direffly uson
her.

In the middle of the wall, opposite to the door, is the temple of Minerva,
with a statue of the goddess in white mai-hle, not in a warlike habit, but in a
gath suitable to a martial deity making peace.

Next to this is another Minerva, not a statue⁷ but a pic‘tnre3 Vulcan is
described as a lover in putsuit of her3 she fiaes ε from [his we :ire to attribute,
