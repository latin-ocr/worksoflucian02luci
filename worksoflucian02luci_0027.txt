THEFALSEPROPHET. 21

Or hear the ini'ry‚ they for thee prepare

The deadly poison; thou wilt find it hid,

Close to the wall beneath thy bed.--Thy maid,
Calista, knows it all.

Would not this nice and accurate description of names and places puzzle a
Democritus, and yet when he had found out the trick, how would he laugh

at the contents ?
He would often answer the Barbzzrians, who asszed him questions in Celtic

or Syriae, in their own language, though sometimes he found it difficust,
not having people near tointerpret them for him : but then he always took
care there should be time enough between the delivery of the books, and
the oracle to be given, that he might have leisure to open and procure per-

sons to explain them.
Of this kind was one given to a Scythian, which ran thus,

Morphi Ebargulis Chnenchichranc—he should die.

This also he wrote in prose to Nobody,

Return-—for he who sent thee was this day ss²ain by his neighbour Diocles,
Mangus, Celer, and Eubulus, the robbers, coming upon him, who were
taken and bound.

Now listen to a few, which he delivered to me3 my question was, whe-
ther Alexander was bald; this Isealed up very curioussy3 the answer was,

ἕ· Malaeh Attis was different from Sabardalachus.

’ Another time, when in' two separate books, and under two different names,
I asked the same question,—viz. Of what country Homer the poet was?

To one them he answered,
With † cytmis I command thee to anoint‚

And fair ‡ Latona's dew

 

⁸ Maluit, Essa]v Here Lucian does not sufficiently explain the fafi, so as to make it intel-
rigible to his readers· Some servant sent to Alexander, had probably proposed this question to
him, viz. Were Malach Attia, and Sabardalachus, (two obscure kings of some distant region,
one and the same person? Alexander mistaking this question for Lucian’s, gives him this answer,
which, by the bye‚ does not prove what Lucian would insinuate, that Alexander said any thing
that came uppermost; but only that he frequentlyx sent answers to one question, which properly
belonged to another. A circumstance that might happen to any man in the hurry of business ς,
just the same mistake is made with regard to his question about Homer.

ἦ Cytmis.] Bear’s grease. ’

ss Latona's de=w.] Latona is put for Diana, or the moon; the dew must be gathered whilst the

moon. mines. This superstition gives it an air of solemnity„
