lie was balal-pared, and had a hooked nofe? There is another thing too,
which I would ask you: how happens it that one ring could not do all this
for you, but you must needs load every finger of your left hand; and be ob·
liged, rnoreover‚ to call in the right to help you off with them. One thing,
aster all, which is above all more necessary than any thing else, you seem to
have forgot, and that is, a remedy for insanityz a dose of hellebore might,

1 have no occasion to wish norv, for we are got to the double gate; what
with my friend Samippus here fighting at Babylon, and Timolaus dining at
Syria, and supping in Italy, all the time appointed for me is expired‚ which
I arn not sorry for: I have no mind, after a short feast of imaginary happi-
ness, to figh and be wretched, when I corne back to my homely meal, as
will soon be your fate, when all your treasures and delights are flown away,
when you are driven from your thrones, waked out of your pleasant
dream, and return to your own houses, where you will find every thing very
different. Like tragedy kings, who, after being Creons and Agamemnons
on the stage, frequently starve at horne 3 then every thing will ‚displease you,
especially Timolaus, who must fall like another Icarus, when his wings are
melred, aud the rings are all ssipped off his fingers. For my own part, I
would not, to purchase all your treasures‚ nay, and Babylon itself, lose the
pleasure which I have in laughing a't the ridiculous wishes made by such a
set of wife philosophers„
