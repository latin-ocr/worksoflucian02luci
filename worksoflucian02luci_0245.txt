U S T I C E.
The first cause to come an is that between Drunkenncss and the Aca-
[demyz come, pour in the water: do you, Drunkenness, spcak first;
what! not a word to say fot yourself, only nodding. Mercury, attend and

listen.
M E R C U R Y.

She says, she cannot plead her cause, for the wine has tied up her tongue,
and she is afraid of being laughed at: you see she can hardly stand.

JUSTICE.

O,' let her employ an advocate3 one of the sharpest she can get; there
are enough of them- here that will crack their lungs for three half-pence.

M E R C U R Y.
But nobody chuses openly to defend the cause of Drunkenness, though
she certainly has a claim to it.

J U s T 1 c E.
What is to be done then?

M E R C U R Y.
The Academy is always ready to plead on both fides of the question, and
she has offered to do it now3 she says, she will speak first for her, and then

for herself.
J U S T 1 e E.

That is quite a new scheme; however, come, Academy‚ and plead on
both fides, as it is so easy to you.

A C A D E M Y.

servant Polemon, who alxvays looked upon me as his best friend, and did
every thing that I bade him. He used to be for ever wandering about with
fidlem, roaring, a'nd drinking from morning to night, with a garland of
flowers on his head; this the whole Athenian· people can bear witness to,
who never saw him sober ; but, chancing one day, in his rambles, to stumble
upon Academy, she laid violent hands upon him, dragged him away from
me, forced him to drink water, and be sober, tore off his gatimid, and, in-
stead of giving him something to drink in bed, taught him certain hard ari'd.
