said Demonax, instead of a Roman, he had made a Grecian of you.'’ Seeing
afine—dreffed man who was very proud of his purple robe, he went up close
to him, and laying hold of his garment, cried, ‘⁶ This belonged to a 4 sheep
before you had it '⁹ Going to bathe one day in warm water, he seemed afraid
of steppinginto it, and sornebody reproaching him for a coward, he replied,
“ I do not do this to save my country.’' ‘⁶ What do you think they are about,
said somebody, in the shades below ?” ‘⁴ Stay till Iget there, says he, and Ι
