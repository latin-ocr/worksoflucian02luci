That Homer, my good friend, was an admirable poet, all will readily
allow you; but not that he, or any other poet, is a properjndge in these
matters: truth is not their object, but merely to delight their readers, for
this ⁴reason they fing in verse, and aCt in sables : every thing they do is mere-
ly with a view to please and divert. But Ι ssiould be glad to know what part
of Homer’s works you place your implicit faith in: is it in that ὕ where he
tells us, that thev daughter, brother, and wife of Jove plotted against, and
would have bound him in chains, and if Thetis, ont of conipaffion, hid
not called in Briareus to his affistance, our good Jupiter had been snatched
away from υς, and thrown into a dungeon3 and for this good office he repaid
Thetis, by deceiving Agamemnon with a† false dream, that cost many a
Grecian their lives ; had not he better have thrown a thunderbolt at Aga-
memnon, and destroyed him, than thus have played the hypocrite and im-
postor? Or, perhaps, you were drawn into this opinion by hearing that 1 Ve-
nus was wounded by Diomede, and afterwards Mars himself, at the instiga-
tion of Minerva: soon after this, all the gods, male and female, engage
along with mortals in the battle, and Minerva gers the better of Mars, weak-
ened, l suppose, by the wound he had received from Diomede, and

ᾧ Against Latona march’dthe son of May.

Or, perhaps, you was struck with the probability of Η Diana’s resenting her
not being invited to Oeneus's feast, and, in revenge,sendinga horrible wild boar
to ravage his country. Were these some of l‘lomer’s excellent persuafives?
