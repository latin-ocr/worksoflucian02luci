with ardour, and embrace him tenderly at his departure from her3 who
always took care to wear every thing that was agr-eeable to him, who
sung· and played admirably; for all those arts did she praetise against the
unhappy Dinias3 when, at length, 1116 perceived he was † steeped in
love, 1116 had recourse to an artifice, which 1116 knew would be a finishing
stroke3 {he pretended to be with child by him3 1116 would corne no 111016

heard of her intrigue with 111111. This was more than he could bear3 not
to see her was absolutely intolerable3 he wept‚ and raved before the syco-
phants, called on the name of Chariclea, and embraced her statue, which
had been mad-e for him of white marble‚ and cried out in agonies‚ then
thtew himself down on the ground, and was almost distraeted ; instead of
apples and garlands, he sent her whole fields⁴ and houses, servant3‚ fine
eloaths, and as much gold as she could defire3 in short, in a very little space
of time, the richest and noblest house in all Ionia was emptied, and its trea-
sures entirely consumed. When Dinias was at length sucked dry‚ and to-
tally exhausted, 1116 got another lover, a Cretan youth, ofa good fortune,
whom 1116 pretended to be fond of, and who thought himself equally be-

reception of the Cretan rival, affuring him after all that he could 1101 1116

to reproach him for 1115 past behaviour, 111 rejee‘ting such a friend for syco-
phants and flatterers, but went immediately, sold 1115 1131611131 estate at Sa-
mos, which was all that⁴ he had, for two 13161115, and brought them to him.
After the receipt ¹of this, Dinias was again fit to be seen by 0113116163, agiin
he appeared beautiful to her, letters again came to 111111, and the maid was
sent to reproach him for his tedious absence, the flatterers too once more
came about him, finding that he was once more fit to be fed upon : he ap-
pointed a time to meet her, and came to her house accordingly, where he
was no sooner entered than Demonax, the husband of, Chariclen, whether
