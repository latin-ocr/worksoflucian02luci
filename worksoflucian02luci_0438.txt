432 ΟΝ THE DEATH 01² PEREGRINUS.

Methinks Ι see you laughing at the old man’s folly, and crying out, what
madness, what ridiculous vain glory 2 with many other such exclamations‚
’ 35 circumstances of this kind naturally produce. You may do this in safety‚
as you are sar enough off3 but Ι said the same on the very spot, and before
numbers of people, which some of those, I affure you, who admired the
old fellow's bravery, took not a little ill of me; though there were others
who, like me, laughed at his vanity: Ι was very near, however, being
torn in picces by the Cynics, as A&aeon was by his dogs, and ³* Pentheus
by the Maenades, his kind rela÷ions. I will give you an account of the whole
drama, as it was represented. You know the author well enough already,
and what tragedies he has been acting all his life, much superior to those of
AEschylus or Sophocles. When I came first to Elis I heard one of our dis-
puring Cynics, with a loud rough voice, bellowing out his common—place
encomium on Virtue, and abufing all mankind : 1115 discourse then turned on
Proteus, whichI will endeavour to recolledh you will say it is like their
nonsense, for you have often heard them declaim.

ancestor, dare any man accuse Proteus of vain-glory, that Proteus who was
bound in Syria, he who forgave his country five thousand* talents, he who
was banished from Rome, he who is more celebrated than the sun, he who
is able to contend even with Olympian Jove ? Because 116 15 resolved to leap
into the flame and bravely perissi, they call it the love of glory 2 but did not
Hercules thus peristi also? Were not Bacchus and AEsculapius struck with
lightning3 and did not Empedocles, in latter times, leap into the flames ?'’

When Thagenes (for that was the bawler's name), had finished his ha-
tangue, 1 3111611 0116 of the by-standers, what he meant by the fite, or what
relation Hercules and Empedocles had to Proteus. “ Proteus (replied he),
intends very soon to burn himself at the Olympic games.'’ “ But how, said I,
and for what reason ?’' He was going to answer me, when the Cynic bawled
so loud that I could not hear any thing but what he thought proper himself
to add concerning Proteus, on whom he bestowed the most lavish enco-

† Pentheus.] Son of Echion and Agave, daughter of Cadmus: he succeeded his grandfather in
the kingdom of Thebes, and having an unfortunate defire of prying into the mysterious rites of
Bacchus, which he suspested to be rather licentious‚ he hid himself in a part of mount Cithe-
ron, but being discovered, was set upon by the Bacchanalian women, amongst whom was his
own mother, and some of his relations, and torn to pieces by them. See the Bacch. of Euri-
pides, and Virgil’s AEneid, book iv. v. 469.
