OuDANCING. 37

sacred a thing to become 3 subje& of public trial, as it were, and examina·
ti0n3 not to mention that there is a city in Italy, which has added this or-
nament to their other games and ceremonies.

I must here apologize to you, for omitting many things which Ι might
have mentioned on this occafion: 1 am not ignorant that several who have
treated the farne subject before me have dwelt much longer upon it, have
run through every species of dancing, g1ven us their names, and described
what they were, and by whom invented, with a view, {suppose, to shew
their extensive learning; for my own part, 1 look upon allthis, as the pot r
ambition of the ignorant; and befidcs thar, it would be very troublesome and
inconvenient to rne, and for that reason Ι pass thern all over. I rnust defire
you, moreover, to recolleft, that it was not rny present intention to trace
out the origin of every kind of dance, but only to describe the few which 1
first mentioned, and which, Ι confidered as the principal efforts of this noble
art. The chiefend of this discourse being to recommend dancing in general,
and to shew how much, both os pleasure and profit, there is in it : Ι mean,
as it is now praetised, not as it was formerly, but with all the improvements
which it received in, and fince the time of Augustus. Paffing over, as it
were, the roots and foundation of the art, we come now to the flovver and
fruit of it. Taking no notice of the* Thermaystris, the † Crane, and the ’
rest of those which are foreign to our present practice· nor shall Ι mention
the ἶ Phrygiam dance, made use of, generally, by boon companions in their
drinking bouts; and which, our rustics continue to this day to the found of
nutes, which, likewise, have very little resemblance with our presentmodcs
and fashions. Plato, in his laws, finds fault with several of these; in his di-
vision of thern into the useful and agreeable, rejensting some as rude and in-
decent, and praifing and admiring others. So much therefore, for the art
itself. For to describe all the species of it would be a ridiculous and un-

necessary tafk.

ἦ Thermaystris.] A remarkabl) quick dante, abounding' in leaps and caprioles, such as re-
quired the greatest strength and agilit). Athenaeus calls it furiosa saltatio, a mad dance; and
another author callsit, genus saltationis vehementis, δι prae ipuae agilitatis.

† The cr.ane ] Greek, ’γε μανον, so called, we may suppose, from the ffight ofthat bird, whose
motions were probably imitated by the lancers.

ξ Phrygian. ] This was probably, as it is described to us, a rustic popular dance, in
which the pertormem, as they danced, sung to the dance tunes—When? are my roses, where
..re my violets, where are my beautitul 1warms of bees, &c
