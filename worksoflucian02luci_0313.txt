accord, because you have heard all mankind unite in praise of my perfectione.
and, astonissoed at my superiority, yield the palm to me, soon shall xou
know how divine a person you are applying to. You will not compare ν1111·
to common men, but think what I shall sslcw you, beyond all that a * Tity-
us, an Otus, or Ophialtes could produce: my voice shall excel every other,
as much as the trumpet doth the pipe, the bee a grassropper, or the 11111

chorus, every little chanter.
“ lf you wish to be an orator, nobody can teach you better than rnyself;

follow me, therefore, thou favourite of Apollo, mind whatI say, and look
forward to every thing thou canst defire, but mark the laws which I lay
ἢ down, and observe them well; go on boldly, and without delay3 be not
⁵ afraid because thou art not first initiated by vain pretenders, who would
{hew thee another path; we shall not want their affistance; ssep in, as the
proverb says, with unwashed feet, thou wilt be never the worse for it ; nay,
not even ffiouldst thou not be able to write thy name3 a true orator is above

all these things.
‘⁴ But, first, I must tell you what provifion you are to bring along with you,

and-what neceffaries for thejourney ; and then, by my advice and directim,
before sun-set, I will make you as good an orator as myself, who know the
beginning, and the middle, and the end of every thing that can, or ought
to be said. Bring with you, therefore, a great deal of ignorance, with much
confidence, and, above all, a large quantity of boldness and affurance: as
to modesty‚ blushing‚ truth, and equity, you may leave thern at home, as
totally useless, and contrary to our dcfign : forget not, however, the loudest
bawling you can produce, an impudent tone, with gait and gesture ex-
actly like mine. These are absolutely necessary, and these alone are sufficient.
, Let your dress be white, with flowers upon it, and of the † Tarentino make,
that the body may be seen through it; your ssippers Attio, such as the wo-
men wear, and finely wrought3 or a ‡ Sicyonian 11106, which suits admirably
with a white hat3 bring a good many servants with you, and always carry

† Tar-entim] The linen of Tarentum was, probably, a kind of gause‚ so remarkably fine as
to be almost pellucid, and consequently shewed the ladies or gentlemens li'mbs who wore it to
the greatest advantage.

ἶ Sicyonianfhoe] This kind of shoe, so called from the place where it was made, and gene-
- rally worn by the ladies ; though the macaronies of that age, as we find by this passage, sorne-
times made use ofthem. Si mihi calceos (says Tully,) Sicyonias attuliffes‚ non uterer, quamvis

effent habiles, δι apti ad pedem ; sed non viriles. See Cic. de Orat. b. i.
