By the ²³ unknown god of* Athens, Ι ἱκνεατ,”’ΤῑὶεΡΙιοη, she remain0d12
virgin till her head was· eut off. ⁴

† lf any body can cut off a virgin’s head, it will immediately become a
wonderful thing to frighten the multitude with: if Ι had known³this⁷ be· ,
sore, I could have brought you a fine quantity of Gorgons ,from ζ. Crete,
where ten thousand virgins were cut to pieces : what an unconcfferable ge-
neral might I have made you with these! the poets and orators would have
celebrated me as a much greater hero than Perseus. But now Ι mention the
Cretans, I remember their ssiewing me the sepulchre of your Jupiter,
with the groves and meadows where his mother brought him up, and which,
they say, are clothed in perpetual verdure.

But you know nothing of orgies and incantations.

T R 1 E P H Ο N.
q lf incantations could do this, they might raise the dead also to light and
life: but these are all idle fables of the poets; therefore, say no more of

them.

You will not refuse to accept of Juno, I hope, the sister and wife of Jove.

T R 1 E P H 0 N.
Let us hear no more, 1 beseech you, of that incestuous deity; but leave

her, tied hand and foot, as Jupiter did.

“ The unknown] The Athen'mns, not content with worssiipping an infinitevnumber of local
and ture-lnry deides, erested nn altar, and dedicated it, τον aynano Θεω, to the Unknown God3
a kind of tacit acknowledgment, that they were diffatisfied with all their deities, and had some
imperfect notion of a true God‚ far superior to them.

ἧ- Ifany body ] Arch and sensible t from this, and many other paffages‚ it appears to rne, in
spite of Gesner, and all the learned commentators‚ that the Philopatris‚ if not written byLucizim
is a very close and happy imitation of his style and manner.

1 From cvm] The critics are much puzzled about this story, of which history gives no sa-
tisfactory account. Some refer it to a tale of Ursulo, from Britain, with her eleven thousand
virgins, cut in pieces by the Hunns. This makes the story, and consequently the author of
Philopatris‚ yery modern indeed. Others tell us, it :illudes to a number of chaste virgins, sa·
crificed in the time of the emperor Julian. After all, it is, probably, nothing but a lye of the
Κςητες αειψευςοι, the lying Cretam, current about that period, and laid hold on by the author,

whoever he was, as applicable to his subjeer. R
