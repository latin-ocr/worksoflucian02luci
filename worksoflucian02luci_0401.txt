LONGEVITY.

‘I his little Piece of Lucum’s is ζ to speak in the Language of Painsers), in his worst
Adannem being nothing more than an Enumeration ⁰f Pmfims who were remark·
able fhr the Length of their Lives. It was customary, it fhems, at that Tunc,
on the Birth-days of great Men, for Poets, Oratam, and all the Herd of Flat-
