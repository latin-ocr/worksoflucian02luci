426 THE WISHES.

My opinion is, that, as we are fatigued with our walk down to the Piraeus,
and have already gone about thirty stadia, the sun being very hot, for it is
just in the meridiam we had better rest ourselves a little some where amongst
these olives, fit down upon that broken pillar, then get up, and make the

best ofour way home.

Yon are got to Athens, my good friend, when you should be at Babylon,
fitting down before the walls, and planning out the battle.

True: you have refrelhed my memory ; I thought 1 had been in my so-
ber sense& But come, it is your turn to speak.

1 am for the attack, if you think proper3 behave now like men, and be
mindful of your country3 the enemy is coming on, Mars is the word3 as
soon as the trumpet sounds, set up a ss10ut, strike your {hields with the spears,
and rulh in upon them, do not give thern room to aim their darts at us.
Now we are engaged ε Timolaus with his left wing has routed the Medes;
with my troops the fate of the day is yet uncertain; the Perfians fight brave-
ly, and their king is amongst them ; but, see, the whole Barbarian cavalry
eomes upon our right wing; now, Lycinus, be a man, and prepare your

forces for the onset.
L Y C 1 N U S.

How unfortunate ! the whole cavalry coming on, and nobody worth their
attacking but Lycinu53 if they perfist in it, I must e'en run away to the Pa-
laestra, and leave you here to fight the battle by yourselves.

S A Μ Ι P Ρ U S. ,

By no means, for you shall be victorious: you see 1 arn going to have a

single combat with the king; he has challenged me, and it would be coward- ,

lx, to decline it.

ssy Jove, you will soon be wounded by him: to be wounded in fighting
for a kingdom is truly royal,

SAMIPPUS.

You are right; Ι have a ssight wound‚ but it is not in a part of the body
that can be seen, nor will the sear disfigure me hereafter3 but only observe
how 1 have transfixed him and his horse at one stroke with my spear, cut

off
