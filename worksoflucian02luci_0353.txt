ENCOMIUMoNAFLY. 347

extrafits without much pain, and seems to delight in most, though it ‹lrinks
milk also: it has fix feet, four ofwhich it walks on, and uses thie other two
as hands, which it employs to carry the food to irs mouth, in the' same man-
ner as we do.

It is at first a worm, bred in the carcases of men or other animals ; by dc-
grees it puts forth its feet, then gers wings, and becomes a bird, and brer-ds
another worm, which, like itself‚ is soon changed into afly: it frequents
the habitations of men, and partakes of their food3 tasting every thing but
³¹⁶ oil, which is death to it. lts life is † mort, and confined within very nar-
rowlimits3 it rejoices in the day-light, and flies about perpetually3 bnt at
night is motionless, neither flies nor fings, but contraers itself in silence and
obscurity.

It shews no little skill and prudence in avoiding its infidious enemy the
spider, whose motions it caretully watche5‚ that it may not fall into his net :
of its strength and courage I need not speak, as they are celebrated by the
‘³‘ most sublime of poets, who, praifing his favourite hero, compares his va-

,ρ-
lour, not to the lion, the leopard‚ or the boar, but to the boldness and in-

trepidity of the fly : not only attributes strength to it, but contage also; for
when repulsed, it refists, and pursues its blow ε he is, indeed, lo fond of it,
that he makes mention ofit, not once only, but several times, and frequent-
ly adorns his work with encomiums on it. At one time, he gives us ᾗ a de—
scription of their sallying forth in clusters in pursuit of milk3 and at another,
when he is talking of Η Minerva’s turning afide the dart from Menelaus,

¹* Oil.] This is stric‘ssy true: the least drop of oil poured on wasps, bees, or other insedb,
immediately destroys thern, probably by stopping up the poreS, and preventing respiration.
† Short, δα] See Vincent Bourne’s little song on the subjeet, beginning with
Busy, curious, thirsty fly,
Drink with me, &c. .
ξ Μιζββιόἶίηισ.] Gr. μεγαλοφονω τατος. Homer calls it, μυης Sapo(- Pope has changed the

fly into a hornet, ι
So bnrns the vengelul ΗοκΝΕτ, soul all o’er,

Repuls’d in vain, and thirsty still of gore. See Iliad, b. xvii. l. 642.

ξ A dfirr'ptimn] The wand’ring nations of a summer’s day,
That drawn by milky steams at evening hours,
In gather'd swarxns surround the ruz-al bow’rs ;
From pail to pail, with busy murmur run,
The gilded legions glitt’ring in the sun. Homer’s Iliad, b. ii. 1. 553.

§l Minerva's.] So from her babe, when ssumber seals his eye,
The watchful mother wafts th' envenom’d fly.
See Homer’s Iliad, b. iv. l. ⁵62-
