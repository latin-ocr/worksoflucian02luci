diately left them on the floor, and soared aloft into the air by itself.

Rehind Apollo is the statue of Atlas, and, behind that, one of Mercury,
and another of Ilithyia.

Thus is the infide of the temple furnished : without, there is a large altar
of brass, and, near it, above fix hundred statues of Kkings and priests; on the
left, is that of Semiramis, pointing with her right hand towards the temple;
the reason which they affign for this attitude is, that this queen formerly

heads, except the high-priest, who is cloathed in purple, and wears a tiara :
a new one is chosen every year. There is, likewise, an immense quantity
of subordinate Officers in the temple, together with piperS, fidlers, the galli,
