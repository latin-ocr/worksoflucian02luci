16 ALEXANDER;0R',

telling plagues, fires, and earthquakes in every city, and at the same time
promising his powerful affistance against them. One vocal predififion, in

particular, he dispersed about, concerning the plague, in the following verse,

The beardless god, Apollo, shall dispel
This pestilential cloud

 

This was inscribed on almost every door, by way of antidote3 the event,
however, proved rather contradi&0ry, for those houses were peculiarly un-
fortunate, more dying in them than in any others, wherever the verses were
put up. Ι do not say, this was the cause of their deaths, but so it fell out;
for the common people, depending upon the oracle, took no care about
their diet and manner of living, nor would they join their own endeavours
with it to combat the disease‚ having those infallible words to fight for them,
and well afl'ured that the “ beardless god, with his darts, would drive away
the pestilence.''

He had, moreover‚ set spies over every part of Rome, whom he chose out
of his own accomplices‚ who were to get out of the people the questions they
meant to ask, and what they were most defirous of, letting him know all
beforehand‚ that he might be ready with his answers, even before they sent
for them.

Thus he went on in Italy; and now he began to institute certain mysteries,
with sacred rites, priests, torches, and a festival for three days. On the
first, it was given out, as at Athens, in this form,—·“ 1f any wicked person,
Christian, or Epicurean, approaches to pry into the mysteries, let him be
expelled, but let the faithful believers be initiated with propitious omens :''
then began the scrutiny‚ and first they cried, “ Away with the Christians,’'
and the whole multitude subjoined, ‘⁶ Away with the Epicureans ;'' then was
represented the child-birth of Latona, the nativity of Apollo, the nuptials
of Coronis, and the birth of AEsculapius: and on the next day the wonder-
ful produe‘tion of the god Glycon. On the third came the marriage of
Podalirius, with Alexander’s mother3 that day was called the ‘³⁵ Dadae, when
they lit all the torches: and last of all was the representation of the loves of
Alexander and the Moon‚ with the birth os Rutilianus’s wife, wherein Alex-
ander led the proceffion‚ with a torch in his hand, like another Endymi0n;
laying asleep in the middle of the room, whilst a beautiful creature, whose
