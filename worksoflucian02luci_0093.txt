and Venus. They, says she, are far beyond me; b0yond‚ indeed, any
thing human: nor do Idefire to be put on a level with Penelope, Arete,
and Theano, any more than with the first of the goddeffes. I am a religious
worshipper of the gods, and fearful of offending them, and were Ι to admit
such fiattery‚ should dread the fate of ἦέ Caffiopeia, though she only com—
pared herself to the Nereids, and adored Juno and Venus. This part, 'there-
sore, she defired you would alter; she would, otherwise, call those goddciles
to witness, it was not written by her defire, or with her approbation, but was
entirely disagreeable to her, as void of piety and religion. She should look
upon it as irnpious, to suffer herself to be compared to the Cnidian or Gar·
den Venus; and begged you would recollect what you said yourself, to-
wards the end of your book, when you praised her modesty and humble be-
haviour, that never soared above human nature, but confined its ssight with-
in the limits of mortality; and yet you lift her up to heaven, and compare
her to the inhabitants of it. She would rather wilh you thought her capable
of imitating Alexander, who, when the sculptor promised to make mount
Athos into a statue of him, with two cities in his hand, would not en-
courage such a ridieulous scheme, but advised the man to let it remain as it
waS, and not attempt to fashion a mountain of such an immense fize, into the
shape and resemblance of a diminutive mortal. She praised, at the same
time, the conqueror’s greatness of mind, which, she said, would raise a
nobler statue to him than Athos itself in the opinion of posterity, as it was
doubtless a proof of the highest tnagnanimity to despise and reje& so great
an honour.

For herself, she said, she much admired the ingenuity and perfectior] of
your portraits, bnt could by no means admit of their likeness to her, as nei-
ther ssie, nor any other woman, could ever arrive at such perfeetion. She
begs leave, therefore, ro return the intended honour back upon your hands,
and with all humility adores your archetypes; begs you would praise those
virtues only, which ,are within the reach os humanity‚ and that you would not
make the lhoe too big for the foot, lest it should throvv her down, when she
walks in it.

ed th'at (he was handsomer thanJuno, which the goddess, as we may naturally suppose, was
highly incensed at, and took the first opportunity to make an end of her. She met, however,
afterwards with a noble recompence for her sufferings on earth, being placed, with all her fa-
mily, in heaven, where {he still {hines as a constellation.
