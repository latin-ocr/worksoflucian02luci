subjcet to colliquation‚ nor, till the latter part of life, to infirmities or decay;
for to return to my allusion of the corn, if you set it on fire, the flames will
first dcslroy the stubble, and afterwards the grain, which will smoke and take
fite by degrees z and in like manner, such bodies as 1 have been describing
to yon, will not soon or eafily be subdued either by toil or distemperature;
their interior parts being well prepared, and the external so defended as not to
be hurt by heat or cold : {fat any time they yicld to extraordinary fatigue‚ the
vital spirits within, supplies them with fresh vigour, and alacrity3 insomuch,
that increase of labour, only incre‘ases strength, and renders thern indefa-

We teach them likewise to run races, which makes'them swift of foot,
and prevents their being out of breath ; the course, moreover, is not' on so-
lid ground, but in a deep sand, where the foot can never be firm, but ssips
away from beneath them ε we exercise thern likewise in leaping over ditches,
with leaden weights in their hands, and teach them to throw darts at a great
distance: you must have seen also in the gymnasium, a brass thing like a
small shield, round, and without a handle or strings3 you took one up, I
rcmember, and thought it very heavy, and so smooth that you could not
hold it; this they throw up into the air, or 4 strait forwards, contending

testimonies of Homer, Ovid, and Statius. The disc was probably composed of different mate-
rials, as iton, brass, stone, or wood, and thrown underhand, much in the same manner as the
quoit is arnongst us, though not as we do at any particular mark, their whole endeavour being
to throw beyond one another, and he who threw furthest obtained the vietory. With the

Greeks it was only a trial ot* strength, with us it is a ganne offkill also.
