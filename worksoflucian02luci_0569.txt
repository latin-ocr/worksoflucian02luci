CHARIDEMUS. 563

of a vistory which he had gained at the 4 Dialia, by writing a book. He
recounted a number of agreeable things that happened there; and, amongst
the rest, told me of some speeches made in praise of beauty, which he could
not himself, he said, being an oldernan, perfeffly remember, especially as
he was there but a little time: you, however, he was sure, could repeat
thern eafily, as you were one of the speakers, ancl had attended to every
thing during the whole entertainrnent.

It was, indeed, Hermippus, as he told you z but, 1 am afraid, Ι cannot
accurately describe it all; nor could 1 hear every thing, for the noise made
by-the company and servants together3 belides, that it is one of the most
difficult things in the world to remember what paffes at a feast, as you very
well know how forgetful it is apt to make even those who have the best
memories: to oblige you, however, lwill endeavour to do it as well as I
can, and give you as many circumstances asI can possibly recollect.

H E R M Ι P P U S.

Ithank you for your kind promise; but, if you would gi've me an ex-
a& detail from the beginning, tell me the name of the work which Andro-
cles repeated, who it was he conquered, and who were your guests, 1 should
be infinitely obliged to you.

C H A R I D E M U S.
The book, Imentioned, was, the Praise of Hercules, written by him,

and delivered to him, as he said, in a dream3 the man he gained the victory
over was Diotimus, of Megara, who contended with him sor a -Γ barley
cake, or, rather, merely for honour and glory.

⁴‘ Diafia.] A feast so called, in honour of Jupiter the Propitious, um w Διος xz· τῆς own,
from Jupiter and missorrune; because, by making supplication ιο jupiter, they obtained pro-
tection and deliverance from every evil.

νῇ- Bar-lay cake.] A barley-cnke may appear to us but a poor reward fora good poem, and,
perhaps too much for a bad one: the ancientS, however, :is Mr. West sensibly observes, distri-
buted such prizesrfor very goodreasons, being such as, ‘⁶ having no intriniic value in them-
selves, could be of no use to the conquerors, but merely as emblems or evidences of their victo-
ries, and, as such, entitled them to the esteem and applauses of their counrrymenz by the
meanness of these were the Grecians given to understand, that praise and glory were the proper
recompense of merit and virtue.’' See West’s Differt. on Olympic Games.—After till, a cuke
of any kind, is more than many a modern poet either gets‚ or perhaps deserves, for his per-
formance ; and a barley-cake as fit a reward for the Choice of Hercules, as a butt of sack for a

Birth-Day Ode.
