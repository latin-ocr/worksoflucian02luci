“ The world (said he), hath beheld only two perfefi‘t works, the Olympian
Jove, and Proteus; Phidias formed the one, the other was the work of na.
ture3 but now, alas! this noble image must go from men to the gods, and
leave us wretched orphans all behind him.'' When, after much toi] and
sweating, he had thus delivered himself, he wept most ridiculoussy, and tore
his hair, taking care, however, that he did not pull off too much of it; at
⁴length, fighing and sobbing, he was carried off by some of his friends for
a little consolation.

amongst those who have had reason to know him but too well. This fam-«us
work of nature, this model for Polycletus, no sooner arrived at man's estate
than he was caught in adultery at a certain place in Armenia, where he was
obliged to jump out at a window, aster he had received a severe drubbing:
not to mention his debauching a beautiful girl, whose parents he bribed with
three thousand denarii, not to carry him before the governor of Afia. These
