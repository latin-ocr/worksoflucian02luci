double for your painS.
· D Ι A L O G U E.

[shall not trouble the court with a long speech, but, as my custom iz,
be brief as poffible3 ignorant though Ι am of forms, I will procem} jn my
accusation, and support it in the usual manner. Thus far mv exordiuuU
and now to the injuries and affronts which l have received from this matr,
which are as follows: to wit, taking me, who was always, hitherto, nst-d
to talk in the sublime and lofty style, to walk over the clouds, and through
the air,

’Δ ᾖ Where mighty Jove, through the wide aether drives
His rapid charior.

And whenI was just got to the pinnacle of all things, stopping me in my
flight, breaking my wings, and reducing me upon a level with the multi-
tude: taking offmy modest tragie mask, and purting me on a comic and
satiric one3 {hutting me up with bitter jests, keen iamffics, and cynic licen-
ciousness3 joining me with Eupolis and Aristophanes, men who laugh at,
and are severe upon every thing3 and, which is worse, introducing me to
the company of that snarling cur, Menippus, who fawns upon, and bites
you at the same time. Is not it the worst of treatment, not to suffer me to
wear my own cloaths, and force me to talk comedy, stuff, and uonsense?
Then, what is most absurd of all, to make such a strange jumble of me, that

1 am neither prose nor verse, but a mixed unaccountable composition, which
the hearers know not what to make of.

It is an attack which Ilittle expe&ed; 1 had reason, indeed, to hope for
different treatment from him, whom I found with a melanchdy coun-
tenance, shrivelled up with dry interrogatories‚ grave, indeed, and respeffib
able3 but sower, aukward, and ungracious. Itaught him to walk on the
ground like a man, cleansed him from his filth and massine—ss, and gave
him a smile of complacency, that made him agreeable to all beholder53 bv
