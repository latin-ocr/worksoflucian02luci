376' APOPHRAS.

over, lest I alone should be blamed for being ignorant of what is known to
all the world beside.

But, suppose Ι call in to my aid, ἥ Elenchus‚ one of Menander's Prolo-
gisers, that friend to truth and liberty, one of the best that comes upon the
stage, an avowed enemy to such as you and you alone, who are afraid of him,
because he knows every thing about you, and can tell it with eloquence and
grace: if he would come and explain the whole story to the spcc‘tators, no·
thing could be more delightful. Approaeh then, Elenchus, thou best of
prologues and of deities; observe‚ you are talking to those who come not
with minds prejudiced by hatred and animosity, who come not, as they say,
with unwashed feet, to such as mean to resent their own injuries, and, at the
same time, revenge the public cause, by prosecuting a rascal. When you
have done this properly, you may depart, and leave the rest to me, for I
mean to follow your example. There are some things, indeed, my dear
Elenchus, which it will better become me to say, than yourself, as it is not
fitting for a god to be bufied in such dirty matters,

The Prologue, then, begins thus:

A certain sophist came one day to the Olympic games‚ to repeat an † ora-
tion written long ag03 the subjest was Pythagoram, whom the Athenians
had excluded from the Eleufinian rites, as a Barbarian, for say-ing he had

his friends, (a cunning fellow, and versed in these things,) to chuse Pytha-
goras for the subject3 the man did so, and begged the audience would listen

to the oration. The pains which he took in conneeting the several parts,

Menander we have,

“ The god Elenchus, friend to truth and freedom.’'

ἦ· oratiam] These extempore orations were, it should seem, a kind of public exercise, not
unlike our college declmafions, supposed to be spoken extempore, immediately after the subject
was given out, of which, notwithstanding, as here intimated, the speakers had private notice,

and consequently were prepared accordingly, some, with new speeches made by themselves, and
others, like Timarchus, with old ones ready cut and dried, which served for the occafion. The

certain {ophlilstgl mentioned by Lucian, is undoubtedly Timarchus, against whom this whole
prece is eve e .
