that he would lead his whole army over the river dry-shod‚ and by his inge-
nuity performed it, not that he profeffed any peculias {kin -in mechanistn‚
but was a man of excellent genius and invention. It would be going too
far back, to speak of Epeos, who not only made the famous Grecian horse, but
was, himself, one os those uho got into it. And here it is but justice in me
to mention Hippiam, a nian of our own times, though equal to any of the
ancients in learning, geniuS, and eloquence ; superior, not in words, but in
works also, to all those who went before him: most men are proud enough
if they excel in any one thing which they undertake, but he is an excellent
mechanic‚ and, at the same time, a good geometrician, and a master of
mufic, as perfedtly sstilled in every one of them as if he had profeffed that,
and that alone. Add to this, his knowlege in the doctrine of specula, the
rest-aetion of the rays of light, and astronomy. Butl cannot pass over a
work of his, which I lately beheld with astonishment 2 the building of baths

of one is ttuly wonderful5 the situation of it was not a plain, but ssoping,

foundation under it, and securing it with firm supports: the whole struc‘ture
was well proportioncd‚ and the windows of proper fize and distance. You

steps, which leads you to a spacious hall for servants to wait in; on the left‘
hand, are bed-chambets to retreat to, a convenience which baths should
never be without; with another aparttnent, which, though not absolutely
necessary in a bath, may contribute to the happiness of the rich and luxuri-

rate and gentle beat, so as not to hurt you by the intenseness of it ; and, beyond
this, is a most delightful chatnber, with two doors of polissied Phrygiam marble,
