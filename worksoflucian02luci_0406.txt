was eighty-four, as he tells us himself in the preface to it. Polybius, son
of Lyeontas, the Megaltwolitari, as he was coming out of the country,
fell from his horse, and 601111361εά a disorder which carried him off just on
the day that completed his eigliry›second year; and Hypsicratcs‚ the Amy-
66111311, a writer, and a man of the deepest eruditiori, lived to the age of

ninet 1-1110,
Adiongst the orators, Gorgias, by some called the Sophist, died, by a

voluntnry abstinence from all food, at a hundred and eight : when 116 was
11111611 what could be [116 cause of his living so long, and retaining his licalth
and senses to such an extraordinary old age, he used to say, it was owing to
his stajving nt home, ond not indulging at other men’s rables. Isocrates
wrote his famosis Panegyric at ninety-fixst and in his ninety—ninth year,
when 116 was 10111 that Ph³lip had beaten the Athenians at Chaeronaea, hc
repeated, in a moui-nful tone, this verse of Euripides, applying it to
himself:
‘⁴ '¹‘ When Cadmus 6111 his much-lov’d Sidon left,”

and then adding, that Greece henceforth would be reduced to ssavery, he
expired. Apollodorus, of Pergamos, the rhetorician and preceptor to Au-
gustus Caesar, together with Athenodorus, the philosopher, of Tarsus, lived
to the same age of eighty—tvvm and Potamon, an orator of some note, to
ninety. ⁷

Amongst the poets, Sophocles, the famous tragic writer, died at ninety-
five, being choaked with a grape-stone ; towards the close of his fife, †his
son Iophon aecused him publicly of being out of his senses, when he pro-
(luced before the judges his Oedipus Coloneus; a sufficient proof of the
soundness of his mind, insomuch that the court bestowed the highest enco-
minms on hirn, and condemned the son as a madman, in suppofing his
father to be so. Cratinus, the comic poet, lived to upwards of ninety,
having just before gained the prize by his Pytine Philemon also, another
6011116 writer, laid himself down quietly on his bed, at the age of ninety-·
seven, and perceiving an ass devouring the figs which had been brought
for his own dinner, he called his servant, and ordered him to bring the ass .
some wine, then burst into a loud laugh which choaked him, and he died.
