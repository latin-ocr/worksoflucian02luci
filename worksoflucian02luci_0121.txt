had related the story, 1 know how you would have embellisswl it, and told
us whatDandamis said in his petition, how he was blinded, what he spoke
on the occasion, how he got back, and with what applaul'e ne was received,
with other things which you Grecians so well know how to flouriih on.

Now attend to another instance no less worthy of admiration. Belittas,
a near relation of that Amyzoces, saw his friend Basthes, as they were hunt-
ing together, dragged off his horse by a lion, who had seized him by the
head, and was going to tear him in pieces with his claws, when leaping
down, he rushed upon the beast, put his fingers within his teeth, and cn-
deavoured, but in vain, to save Basthes from his devouring jaws; the lion
then leaving his first prey just exphing, turned upon Belittas, and, with a
grasp, killed him also, after having received a ,mortal wound from Belittas's
sword3 so that they all three periffied together. We buried them near to
each other, raifing on one fide of the path a monument, with an effigies of
the two friends, and on the other, that of the lion.

I will now relate to you a third, concerning the friendssaipof Mace-ntes
Lonchates, and Arsacomas. The latter of these being sent. on an embaffy to
Leucanor, a sovereign in the Bosphorus, to demand the tribute which had
been due to us from thence, three months, fell deeply in love with his
daughter Mazaea, a tall and beautiful virgin. The bufiness he went upon
-was now finissied, the king had given his answer‚ and the feast was prepared
for his departure. It is a custom in the Bosphorus for suitors to demand their
virgins in marriage at their public festivals; and it so happened, that at this
time, there were many of them who came in pursuit of Mazaea, kings and the
sons of kings; amongst whom were Tigrapates, king of the Lazi, Adyrma-
chus, ptince of Machlyna, with several others. Those who come on this
occafion, first sup peaceably together, aud when the feast is over, each takes
a cup, sprinkles the wine on the table, declares himself a suitoi· to the vir-
gin, and supports his pretenlions with regard to power, rank, and fortune.
After many, in compliance with this custom, had laid in their claim, and
boasted of kingdoms and treasures in their posseffion, Al‘saconmS, lust of all,
stepped forth, and taking the cup, did not, like the rell, make a tiburien,
(for we never pour out the wine, as thinking it an affront to the dcit)·,jt
drank up the whole at one draught, and thus spake; “ Give me, O king,
thy daughter Mazaea to wife, forl have greater riches and posseffions by far
than either of these.” Leucanor, who well knew that Arsacomas was poor,
