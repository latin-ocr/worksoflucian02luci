in my vultur also, and swore he saw it fly out of the pile, though Ihad
myself placed him there, on purpose to ridicule such mad and foolish
fellows as himself.

You may easily guess the consequence of all this: what a heap of bees
will be settling in that place ! what a congregation of grasshoppers, whata
flight of CL‘OWS will be there, aa many as at the tomb of ³* Hefiod, with a
thousand miracles of the same kind ! Ι doubt not but there will be ψ statues
os him at Elis, and in every part of Greece: for, they say, he has already
wrote letters to all the principal cities, containing his will, his exhortations,

violent fever: this Alexander told me, the phyfician, who was called in on
the occafion3 he found hirn, he said, rolling upon the ground, complaining
dreadfully of the heat, and intreating that he might have some cold water,
which the doetor refused to give him, telling him at the same time, that,
if he was defirous of death he was now at the door, that he could not do bet·
