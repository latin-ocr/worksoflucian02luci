2 ALEXANDER301t,

by which you may be able to judge what an immense dunghil that must be,
which three thousand oxen were so many years in making.

Ι blush, indeed, both for you and myself on this occafion3 for you, who
have thus requested me to employ my pen about so execrable a fellow, and
for rnyself, who have thus engaged to write the history of a man, who doth
not defire the regard and attention of the learned and polite, but is rather fit
to be given up to the populace, and torn to pieces by apes and foxes. If,
however, Ι am blamed for the undertaking, there is an example to excuse
me: Arrian, the disciple of Epictetus, a man of the first character in Rome,
and who spent his whole life in literary pursuits, will plead in my defence by
the similitude which he bore to me, for he condescended to write the life of
'¹‘ Tilliborus the robber. We, on our parts, shall bear record of a much more

cruel and barbarous one, who did not rob in woods and mountains, but
plundered whole cities; did not commit his depredations only on Ida, Mi-
nyas, and the deserts of Afia, but almost throughout the whole Roman em-
pire.

I will first describe to you his external appearance, and draw as good a
likeness ofhim as Ι can, though 1 am no great painter. His body was large χ
and beautiful to look on, and, to say the truth, had something noble and
majestic in it3 his ss-:in clear, his chin not too rough; with his own hair were
mixed some false looks, so well imitated that few could discern the difference
between them, his eyes so bright and sparkling as to appear vmore than hu-
man, his voice to the last degree sweet and clear3 upon the whole, there was
nothing disagreeable or defective iu him.

Such was his external form 3 but for his mind and heart, O Jupiter, Her-
cules, and ye the sons of Jove, avertcrs of every evil, send us rather
amongst our enemies than curse us with such a companion! In understanding,
in subtilty, and smartness, he was excelled by none, and had withal a most
extraordinary readiness in learning, an inquifitive disposition, a genius capable
of every thing, and a tenacious memory; all these he poffeffed in a most
wonderful degree, and made use of thern to the worst of pnrposes: for, with
allthese instrnmcnts of good, he was one of the most wicked of men, even
beyond the {wcercopeffi Eurybatus, Phrynondas, Aristodemus, or Sostra-

catalogue of his works.
