was heard making his demand behind the scenes, and the Grecians highly
applauding him, when Nero sent one of his ”4” aetors and commanded him
to yiem, which hc refused, and made a noise amongst the people, where-
upon Nero ordered his own actors to take poffesfion of the stage, as more fit
for it; these rnen had ivory tablets in their hands, open at both ends, and
pointed like daggers, with which fastening the Epirot to the next pillar,

they cut his thxoat.

This was a mere triste, for a young man who ssew his own mother: what
wonder was it that he should take away the life of a tragic player, who at-
tempted to filence the Pythian oraclo, and stop the mouth of Apollo him-
self! though the Pythian placed him amongst the ψ Orestes's, and Alcmaeon's,
who, by the1nu1·ther of their mothers gained a kind ofglory‚ as it was done
to revenge their fathers; but this tyrant had no such excuse to plead, though
he thought himself so much injured by the oracle, which did not say half so

much of him as hedeserved.

No more of that: ’ζ speak not evil, as the proverb says, of the dead.

‘³' Affers] Gr. ὐποκξιτας, histriones. Adolescemulos, says Suetonius, equestris ordinis, δι quin-
que ampliius millia e plebe robustiffimae juventutis undique elegit¹ qui divisi in factiones plau-
suum genera condiscerent, &c-

Hi quidem, says the commentator, plausuum ὅποκςιται, fuere.

1 Speak not, &cst De mortuis nil nist bonum. A trite and foolish maxim3 as, without
proper restrictionis, a compliance with it rnay be attended with many bad consequences‚ and tend
to make men careless of their behaviour in life, and little concernecl for the future consequence-5

of it.
