ILLITERATE BooK-HUNTER. 333

Thus did the golden Evangelus make a most ridiculous figure, dragged
through the crowd, with wounded legs, and picking up [lie scattercd scni-
nants of his fine harp, that was disciplincd as well as himself. A little after
him, appeared one Eumelus, an Elian, who brought an old harp, with
wooden pegs to it; his garments and crown together, were scarce worth ten
drachmas: as he played, notwithstanding, and sung admirably, he gained
the victory with universal applause. l—le laughed at Evangelus, who was [ο
happy in his fine harp and jewels‚ and thus, they say, attacked him, ‘⁶ You,
Evangelus, were crowned with a golden laurel, because you were rich3 Ι,
with a common Delphic one, because 1 was poor ; and yet all you have got
by your finery is, that no body pities your ill success, but you are left to go
off with the contempt and hatred of all, for your ridiculous pomp and

luxurffl’
This Evangelus, my good friend, resembles you exarstly, for you never

mind being laughed at by the speetatorS.

And nour, a-propOS, Ι will tell you an old Lesbian story. When the
Thracian women tore Orpheus in pieces, his head, they tell us, floated on
his lyre down the Hebrus into the bay of Mela, finging a melancholy dirge,
which the lyre, as the wind swelled its chords, accompanied, and in this
manner drove to Lesbos, where the natives buried the head, in the place where
the temple of Bacchus now stands. The lyre was hung up in the temple of
Apollo, and it remained there for a long time: some while after, Neanthus,
the son of king Pittacus, having heard that this same lyre could, though
Orpheus was dead, move, like him, plants‚ stone8‚ and animals, and even,
when nobody touched it, send forth most delightful sounds, resolved to
get poffeffion of it, and accordingly bribed the priests with a large sum of
money to steal it out of the temple for him. When he had got this inva-
luable treasure, not thinking it safe to make use of it in the public city, he
put it in his bosom, went out by night into a private place at some distance,
and there the young man, who was totally ignorant of music, began to
ssrike the chords, hoping, no doubt, that his lyre would yield such divine
sounds as must charm every ear, and that he should be the heir of Orpheus;
when behold! a multitude of dogS, for there were many of them in that
neighbourhood, attracted by the noise, got together, and ²²* tore him in

preces :
