ASTROLOGY.

This little Τναὲἶ of Lucmu's has been handed down to us by the sagacious Critics
and Commentators as a serious Defence of Astrology; though a vein ofdelicate Iro&
and Sarcasm apparently runs through the whole, and must convince every intelligent
Reader, that his Intention was to turn this absurd and pompous Science into ridicas,
It was probably about hzs time creeping into some Degree of Credit, and our Satirss,
therefore, took the first opportunity of laughing at it. Confidered in this Liger,
the Piece hasa confiderable Share of Aderit, and we are only sorry to find it fiafhort.
Many of the Learned have, notwitlstanding, corfidently a ared us, that it is not
Lucmn’s. It is written in the Ionio Dialefi', which is remarkable.

N the following treatise on heaven and the stass, I shall only confidet

their influence over the affairs of human life, with regard to prophecy
and divination. Neither do I meanto lay down precepts, or rules, how to
excel in thisam but only to lament that the learned, who so strenuoussy ap-
ply themselves to other sciences, neither praitise nor pay any respe& to
astrology.

The art is not oflate invention, but delivered down to us by our ancient
kings‚ the favourites os heaven. But the present race of men, from igno-
rance and idleness; either, perhaps, because their opinions on those points
are different from those who went before them, or because they have lit on*
fa-lse prophets and diviners, find fault with the stars, and condemn astrology
as a lying, frivolous, and empty seience3 without any truth or profit in
it. A very unjust and cruel sentence ε for the builder's ignorance is no re·
fleCHon on archite&ure; nor is the unskilfulness of the mufician a reproach,
on mufic. Every art is wife iu itself, though the artists may be fools.

The AEthiopians were the first who distinguished themselves in this branch
of learning: and this we are to attribute partly to their own wisdom, for in
that they were superior to most nations; and partly to the happiness ostheir
fituati0n‚ for the air is always⁴ serene and tranquil round them3 neither- do

they·
